Results are detailed and highlight key findings effectively. Discussion and conclusions are insightful and offer actionable recommendations. The introduction and methods are clear but may lack some conciseness. Results are logical but may miss highlighting deeper insights. Discussion and conclusions are solid but could be more actionable. The introduction and methods are somewhat vague or rushed. Results are presented but may lack depth or logical flow. Discussion and conclusions are simplistic or partially missing. The introduction, methods, and results are poorly developed or unclear. Major parts of the discussion and conclusions are missing or irrelevant. 40 Visualizations Visuals are professional, highly polished, and strongly enhance understanding. Appropriate animations or dynamic elements are used skillfully. Visuals are generally appropriate and support the analysis, but could be improved in design or relevance. Minor flaws or missed opportunities for better storytelling. Visuals are present but are basic, poorly designed, or only loosely connected to the analysis. Important visual aids may be missing. Visuals are missing, poorly designed, or irrelevant to the analysis. Presentation lacks proper visual support entirely. 30 Delivery/Engagement The group presents with full confidence, clarity, and professionalism. They creatively engage the audience, respond to questions effectively, and strictly adhere to the time limit. Delivery is confident but may have minor lapses in clarity or pacing. Audience engagement is adequate but not very dynamic. Time management is acceptable with minor deviations. Delivery shows noticeable gaps in confidence or clarity. Audience engagement is weak. Time management is problematic (either too short or overrunning time limits). Delivery is unclear, unconfident, or disorganized. Little to no audience engagement. Severe issues with time management. 30 Total 100% "],["grouping-process.html", "4 Grouping Process 4.1 How Groups Are Formed 4.2 Announcement of Groups", " 4 Grouping Process Students will be randomly assigned to groups of 4-5 members based on their responses to a pre-course survey. The survey collects information that will be used to ensure fair and balanced groupings. The group assignments will be announced on the first day of the course. 4.1 How Groups Are Formed The groupings are created using RStudio. The coding ensures randomness while incorporating some aspects of the survey responses to balance groups. If you wish to see the code used for grouping, you may contact me directly. However, please note: - The CSV file with survey responses will not be shared to protect your anonymity and privacy. 4.2 Announcement of Groups The group assignments will be distributed on the first day of the course. Please check your assigned group and connect with your group members as soon as possible. "],["data-story-research-question.html", "5 Data Story Research Question 5.1 Guidelines in Conducting Data Story 5.2 Comments on Research Questions:", " 5 Data Story Research Question 5.1 Guidelines in Conducting Data Story 5.1.1 Research Question: In writing your Research Question, you should keep in mind the following acronym: S-M-A-R-T S-Specific M-Measurable A-Achievable R-Relevant T-Time-bound What do you think of this research question: “What is the effect of X(Twitter) on mental health?“ Do you think this question is SMART? How about this question: “What is the relationship between hours spent per day on X/Twitter and reported levels of anxiety among undergraduate students in DLSU during 2020-2021?“ Which of the two achieves the SMART elements? 5.1.2 Relevance What will be asked by the audience? You need to ask yourselves the following questions; if you are able to, you are close to achieving a good presentation! What is the problem to be solved? Who cares about this problem and why? 5.1.3 For the data story, should I use Kaggle? The answer is NO because of the following reasons: It has already been cleaned and curated based on the owner’s own purposes. It may not accurately reflect the real-world data. It has limited context, potentially limiting your ability to interpret findings accurately. While some Kaggle datasets have clear sources, others may have unclear origins or have undergone modifications by multiple users raising concerns about data integrity. Thus, you should use credible sources like statistics from World Bank, government sites, etc. I am not saying that you can already drop Kaggle datasets. You can still use them for the following: Benchmarking: Compare your model on a well-known Kaggle dataset For learning: You can try to match how the datasets in Kaggle have been cleaned. You can also use the datasets to practice your codes before applying them to the data you found from other credible sources. Important to note: Check data documentation from Kaggle; this will help you find the sources and will help supplement your data story with reputable sources. Furthermore, this is LBOMETR class wherein you were taught how to clean a dataset. You have to gather and clean the data yourselves to align with your research question. 5.2 Comments on Research Questions: Please check your emails for comments regarding your research questions. The approved and final research questions will be posted in Animospace as an announcement. "],["basic-introduction-to-r.html", "6 Basic Introduction to R 6.1 Session Information 6.2 Preliminaries 6.3 Quarto Markdown 6.4 Packages 6.5 Instructions for Managing Working Directories 6.6 Note:", " 6 Basic Introduction to R This portion of the book offers an introduction to the basics of R. R offers a wide variety of functionality. Note that this book only offers basic Econometric analysis. It will be useful to have some basic familiarity with R and its syntax but this is not strictly necessary. Each chapter includes both R code and results to make it easier for students to follow along, even without detailed knowledge of R. 6.1 Session Information This version of the book was built using R version 4.4.2. See below for the session information: ## R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31 ucrt) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 ## Running under: Windows 11 x64 (build 26100) ## ## Matrix products: default ## LAPACK version 3.12.1 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Netherlands.utf8 LC_CTYPE=English_Netherlands.utf8 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Netherlands.utf8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Netherlands.utf8 ## ## time zone: Asia/Manila ## tzcode source: internal ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] bookdown_0.46 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] digest_0.6.39 R6_2.6.1 fastmap_1.2.0 xfun_0.55 cachem_1.1.0 ## [6] knitr_1.51 htmltools_0.5.9 rmarkdown_2.30 tinytex_0.58 lifecycle_1.0.4 ## [11] cli_3.6.5 sass_0.4.10 jquerylib_0.1.4 compiler_4.5.2 rstudioapi_0.17.1 ## [16] tools_4.5.2 evaluate_1.0.5 bslib_0.9.0 yaml_2.3.12 jsonlite_2.0.0 ## [21] rlang_1.1.6 6.2 Preliminaries The first step is to gain access to R, which is free and available on the R website: http://cran.r-project.org/. Simply go to the R website, select the appropriate location and operating system, and follow the instructions to download the base distribution of R. RStudio offers a user friendly environment to run R and is recommended. RStudio Screen Once R is opened, we can begin to run commands. R commands can be run directly from the console, from the R script editor or from a text editor separate from R. R offers detailed help files for each function. To access help, run: ?sum All lines proceeded by a # are comments and will not run. For example: # This is a comment. R will not recognize this as a command. 6.3 Quarto Markdown In LBOMETR, Quarto Markdown will be used by the students when submitting the Scripts for the Data Story Archive. Quarto Markdown is a tool for creating documents, reports and presentations using Markdown and executable code. Below is a concise guide to help you get started, along with key shortcuts for both Mac and Windows. 6.3.1 1. Starting a Quarto File To begin creating a Quarto document, follow these steps: Open RStudio. Go to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document. Choose the document type (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) and specify whether the document will include code. For ease, we will use the html document type. I have also added a sample Quarto Markdown file you can copy. Quarto Markdown Template 2. Quarto Key Features Code Chunks Code chunks allow you to include and run code inside your document. Inline Code Embed R code in text using backticks and r .

The packages will not be immediately available when R is opened. A package only has to be installed once on a computer, but the package will have to be loaded every time R is restarted. We can install a package individually as we need them. For example, to install tidyverse and psych, we would do: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;psych&quot;) In the tidyverse package, the ggplot2 is usually included; if you do not see the package in the Packages list at the lower right, you can do this: if(!(&quot;ggplot2&quot; %in% installed.packages()[,&quot;Package&quot;])) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Now that we have our packages successfully installed, we can go ahead and load them into R. Here we will load the tidyverse package as an example. We can use of all the functions available in that package once it is loaded into R. We load packages by using a library() function. The input is the name of the package, not in quotes. library(tidyverse) We can look up all of the functions within a package by using a help() function. For example, let’s look at the functions available in the tidyverse package. help(package = tidyverse) Note that the package argument is necessary to look up all of the functions. We can also detach a package if we no longer want it loaded. This is sometimes useful if two packages do not play well together. Here we will use a detach() function. detach(package:tidyverse) For simplicity, we will assume that the reader has restarted R at the beginning of each tutorial. 6.5 Instructions for Managing Working Directories This guide outlines how team members should set up their local working directories for collaboration, handle .qmd files, and organize them in a shared Google Drive. 6.5.1 1. Local Working Directory Setup Each team member should create a local folder on their own laptops to work on qmd files. This folder is where you will store and edit your files before uploading them to the shared Google Drive. 6.5.1.1 Steps: Create a folder on your laptop named: DLSU_LBOMETR_Section Use this folder to save and organize your .qmd files while working locally. 6.5.2 2. File Naming Convention To avoid confusion, ensure all .qmd files are named as follows: Include your name or initials and a brief description of the content Example: jem_nario_descriptivestatistics.qmd jmn_piechart.qmd 6.5.3 3. Shared Google Drive Setup A shared Google Drive will serve as the central repository for all project files, including: .qmd files from all team members Data files Rendered HTML and PDF files for final submission Supporting documents or references. 6.5.4 4. Workflow for .qmd files For each team member: Work locally Create your .qmd file in your local DLSU_LBOMETR_Section folder Ensure it is well-documented and organized. Upload to Google Drive For the Team Leader: Collect and Combine Files Gather all .qmd files from the team folder on the shared drive. Combine them Render the final report 6.5.5 5. Rendering the Final Report The final report should be rendered in HTML and printed by the team leader. 6.5.6 Summary Workflow Each Team Member: Work on your .qmd file locally. Upload your file to the shared Google Drive under team-members-qmd. Team Leader: Collect .qmd files from the shared drive. Combine them into a single final_report.qmd. Render the final report into HTML and PDF. Upload the rendered files to the final-report folder on the shared Google Drive. This ensures an organized and efficient workflow while centralizing all files in the shared Google Drive for easy access and submission. 6.6 Note: For the next chapters, before coming to class, ensure that you have installed the necessary packages. Therefore, please go to the next chapters of the course book then Find codes that have install.packages. Please install all the packages so that you will not have any issues.
