The survey collects information that will be used to ensure fair and balanced groupings. The group assignments will be announced on the first day of the course. 4.1 Survey Please complete the survey before 14:30 PM on January 6, 2025 using the link: Google Form Survey Link 4.2 How Groups Are Formed The groupings are created using RStudio. The coding ensures randomness while incorporating some aspects of the survey responses to balance groups. If you wish to see the code used for grouping, you may contact me directly. However, please note: - The CSV file with survey responses will not be shared to protect your anonymity and privacy. 4.3 Announcement of Groups The group assignments will be distributed on the first day of the course. Please check your assigned group and connect with your group members as soon as possible. "],["basic-introduction-to-r.html", "5 Basic Introduction to R 5.1 Session Information 5.2 Preliminaries 5.3 Quarto Markdown 5.4 Packages", " 5 Basic Introduction to R This portion of the book offers an introduction to the basics of R. R offers a wide variety of functionality. Note that this book only offers basic Econometric analysis. It will be useful to have some basic familiarity with R and its syntax but this is not strictly necessary. Each chapter includes both R code and results to make it easier for students to follow along, even without detailed knowledge of R. 5.1 Session Information This version of the book was built using R version 4.4.2. See below for the session information: ## R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31 ucrt) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 ## Running under: Windows 11 x64 (build 22631) ## ## Matrix products: default ## ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Philippines.utf8 LC_CTYPE=English_Philippines.utf8 LC_MONETARY=English_Philippines.utf8 ## [4] LC_NUMERIC=C LC_TIME=English_Philippines.utf8 ## ## time zone: Europe/Berlin ## tzcode source: internal ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] bookdown_0.41 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] digest_0.6.37 R6_2.5.1 fastmap_1.2.0 xfun_0.49 cachem_1.1.0 knitr_1.49 ## [7] htmltools_0.5.8.1 rmarkdown_2.29 tinytex_0.54 lifecycle_1.0.4 cli_3.6.3 sass_0.4.9 ## [13] jquerylib_0.1.4 compiler_4.4.2 rstudioapi_0.17.1 tools_4.4.2 evaluate_1.0.1 bslib_0.8.0 ## [19] yaml_2.3.10 jsonlite_1.8.9 rlang_1.1.4 5.2 Preliminaries The first step is to gain access to R, which is free and available on the R website: http://cran.r-project.org/. Simply go to the R website, select the appropriate location and operating system, and follow the instructions to download the base distribution of R. RStudio offers a user friendly environment to run R and is recommended. Once R is opened, we can begin to run commands. R commands can be run directly from the console, from the R script editor or from a text editor separate from R. R offers detailed help files for each function. To access help, run: ?sum All lines proceeded by a # are comments and will not run. For example: # This is a comment. R will not recognize this as a command. 5.3 Quarto Markdown In LBOMETR, Quarto Markdown will be used by the students when submitting the Scripts for the Data Story Archive. Quarto Markdown is a tool for creating documents, reports and presentations using Markdown and executable code. Below is a concise guide to help you get started, along with key shortcuts for both Mac and Windows. 5.3.1 1. Starting a Quarto File To begin creating a Quarto document, follow these steps: Open RStudio. Go to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document. Choose the document type (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) and specify whether the document will include code. For ease, we will use the html document type. I have also added a sample Quarto Markdown file you can copy. Quarto Markdown Template 2. Quarto Key Features Code Chunks Code chunks allow you to include and run code inside your document. Inline Code Embed R code in text using backticks and r .

The packages will not be immediately available when R is opened. A package only has to be installed once on a computer, but the package will have to be loaded every time R is restarted. We can install a package individually as we need them. For example, to install tidyverse and psych, we would do: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;psych&quot;) In the tidyverse package, the ggplot2 is usually included; if you do not see the package in the Packages list at the lower right, you can do this: if(!(&quot;ggplot2&quot; %in% installed.packages()[,&quot;Package&quot;])) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Now that we have our packages successfully installed, we can go ahead and load them into R. Here we will load the tidyverse package as an example. We can use of all the functions available in that package once it is loaded into R. We load packages by using a library() function. The input is the name of the package, not in quotes. library(network) We can look up all of the functions within a package by using a help() function. For example, let’s look at the functions available in the tidyverse package. help(package = tidyverse) Note that the package argument is necessary to look up all of the functions. We can also detach a package if we no longer want it loaded. This is sometimes useful if two packages do not play well together. Here we will use a detach() function. detach(package:tidyverse) For simplicity, we will assume that the reader has restarted R at the beginning of each tutorial.
