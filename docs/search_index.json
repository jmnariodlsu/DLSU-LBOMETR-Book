Severe issues with time management. 30 Total 100% "],["grouping-process.html", "4 Grouping Process 4.1 How Groups Are Formed 4.2 Announcement of Groups", " 4 Grouping Process Students will be randomly assigned to groups of 4-5 members based on their responses to a pre-course survey. The survey collects information that will be used to ensure fair and balanced groupings. The group assignments will be announced on the first day of the course. 4.1 How Groups Are Formed The groupings are created using RStudio. The coding ensures randomness while incorporating some aspects of the survey responses to balance groups. If you wish to see the code used for grouping, you may contact me directly. However, please note: - The CSV file with survey responses will not be shared to protect your anonymity and privacy. 4.2 Announcement of Groups The group assignments will be distributed on the first day of the course. Please check your assigned group and connect with your group members as soon as possible.

How about this question: “What is the relationship between hours spent per day on X/Twitter and reported levels of anxiety among undergraduate students in DLSU during 2020-2021?“ Which of the two achieves the SMART elements? 5.1.2 Relevance What will be asked by the audience? You need to ask yourselves the following questions; if you are able to, you are close to achieving a good presentation! What is the problem to be solved? Who cares about this problem and why? 5.1.3 For the data story, should I use Kaggle? The answer is NO because of the following reasons: It has already been cleaned and curated based on the owner’s own purposes. It may not accurately reflect the real-world data. It has limited context, potentially limiting your ability to interpret findings accurately. While some Kaggle datasets have clear sources, others may have unclear origins or have undergone modifications by multiple users raising concerns about data integrity. Thus, you should use credible sources like statistics from World Bank, government sites, etc. I am not saying that you can already drop Kaggle datasets. You can still use them for the following: Benchmarking: Compare your model on a well-known Kaggle dataset For learning: You can try to match how the datasets in Kaggle have been cleaned. You can also use the datasets to practice your codes before applying them to the data you found from other credible sources. Important to note: Check data documentation from Kaggle; this will help you find the sources and will help supplement your data story with reputable sources. Furthermore, this is LBOMETR class wherein you were taught how to clean a dataset. You have to gather and clean the data yourselves to align with your research question. 5.2 Comments on Research Questions: Please check your emails for comments regarding your research questions. The approved and final research questions will be posted in Animospace as an announcement. "],["basic-introduction-to-r.html", "6 Basic Introduction to R 6.1 Session Information 6.2 Preliminaries 6.3 Quarto Markdown 6.4 Packages 6.5 Instructions for Managing Working Directories 6.6 Note:", " 6 Basic Introduction to R This portion of the book offers an introduction to the basics of R. R offers a wide variety of functionality. Note that this book only offers basic Econometric analysis. It will be useful to have some basic familiarity with R and its syntax but this is not strictly necessary. Each chapter includes both R code and results to make it easier for students to follow along, even without detailed knowledge of R. 6.1 Session Information This version of the book was built using R version 4.4.2. See below for the session information: ## R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31 ucrt) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 ## Running under: Windows 11 x64 (build 26100) ## ## Matrix products: default ## ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Netherlands.utf8 LC_CTYPE=English_Netherlands.utf8 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Netherlands.utf8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Netherlands.utf8 ## ## time zone: Europe/Berlin ## tzcode source: internal ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] bookdown_0.41 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] digest_0.6.37 R6_2.5.1 fastmap_1.2.0 xfun_0.49 cachem_1.1.0 ## [6] knitr_1.49 htmltools_0.5.8.1 rmarkdown_2.29 lifecycle_1.0.4 cli_3.6.3 ## [11] sass_0.4.9 jquerylib_0.1.4 rsconnect_1.3.4 compiler_4.4.2 rstudioapi_0.17.1 ## [16] tools_4.4.2 evaluate_1.0.1 bslib_0.8.0 yaml_2.3.10 jsonlite_1.8.9 ## [21] rlang_1.1.4 6.2 Preliminaries The first step is to gain access to R, which is free and available on the R website: http://cran.r-project.org/. Simply go to the R website, select the appropriate location and operating system, and follow the instructions to download the base distribution of R. RStudio offers a user friendly environment to run R and is recommended. RStudio Screen Once R is opened, we can begin to run commands. R commands can be run directly from the console, from the R script editor or from a text editor separate from R. R offers detailed help files for each function. To access help, run: ?sum All lines proceeded by a # are comments and will not run. For example: # This is a comment. R will not recognize this as a command. 6.3 Quarto Markdown In LBOMETR, Quarto Markdown will be used by the students when submitting the Scripts for the Data Story Archive. Quarto Markdown is a tool for creating documents, reports and presentations using Markdown and executable code. Below is a concise guide to help you get started, along with key shortcuts for both Mac and Windows. 6.3.1 1. Starting a Quarto File To begin creating a Quarto document, follow these steps: Open RStudio. Go to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document. Choose the document type (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) and specify whether the document will include code. For ease, we will use the html document type. I have also added a sample Quarto Markdown file you can copy. Quarto Markdown Template 2. Quarto Key Features Code Chunks Code chunks allow you to include and run code inside your document. Inline Code Embed R code in text using backticks and r .

The packages will not be immediately available when R is opened. A package only has to be installed once on a computer, but the package will have to be loaded every time R is restarted. We can install a package individually as we need them. For example, to install tidyverse and psych, we would do: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;psych&quot;) In the tidyverse package, the ggplot2 is usually included; if you do not see the package in the Packages list at the lower right, you can do this: if(!(&quot;ggplot2&quot; %in% installed.packages()[,&quot;Package&quot;])) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Now that we have our packages successfully installed, we can go ahead and load them into R. Here we will load the tidyverse package as an example. We can use of all the functions available in that package once it is loaded into R. We load packages by using a library() function. The input is the name of the package, not in quotes. library(tidyverse) We can look up all of the functions within a package by using a help() function. For example, let’s look at the functions available in the tidyverse package. help(package = tidyverse) Note that the package argument is necessary to look up all of the functions. We can also detach a package if we no longer want it loaded. This is sometimes useful if two packages do not play well together. Here we will use a detach() function. detach(package:tidyverse) For simplicity, we will assume that the reader has restarted R at the beginning of each tutorial. 6.5 Instructions for Managing Working Directories This guide outlines how team members should set up their local working directories for collaboration, handle .qmd files, and organize them in a shared Google Drive. 6.5.1 1. Local Working Directory Setup Each team member should create a local folder on their own laptops to work on qmd files. This folder is where you will store and edit your files before uploading them to the shared Google Drive. 6.5.1.1 Steps: Create a folder on your laptop named: DLSU_LBOMETR_Section Use this folder to save and organize your .qmd files while working locally. 6.5.2 2. File Naming Convention To avoid confusion, ensure all .qmd files are named as follows: Include your name or initials and a brief description of the content Example: jem_nario_descriptivestatistics.qmd jmn_piechart.qmd 6.5.3 3. Shared Google Drive Setup A shared Google Drive will serve as the central repository for all project files, including: .qmd files from all team members Data files Rendered HTML and PDF files for final submission Supporting documents or references. 6.5.4 4. Workflow for .qmd files For each team member: Work locally Create your .qmd file in your local DLSU_LBOMETR_Section folder Ensure it is well-documented and organized. Upload to Google Drive For the Team Leader: Collect and Combine Files Gather all .qmd files from the team folder on the shared drive. Combine them Render the final report 6.5.5 5. Rendering the Final Report The final report should be rendered in HTML and printed by the team leader. 6.5.6 Summary Workflow Each Team Member: Work on your .qmd file locally. Upload your file to the shared Google Drive under team-members-qmd. Team Leader: Collect .qmd files from the shared drive. Combine them into a single final_report.qmd. Render the final report into HTML and PDF. Upload the rendered files to the final-report folder on the shared Google Drive. This ensures an organized and efficient workflow while centralizing all files in the shared Google Drive for easy access and submission. 6.6 Note: For the next chapters, before coming to class, ensure that you have installed the necessary packages. Therefore, please go to the next chapters of the course book then Find codes that have install.packages. Please install all the packages so that you will not have any issues.

Before we proceed to Data Management, let us first find where we can get data for the Data Story Archive. Note that the data you collect should still ensure that you are following the Code of Ethics and analyze Ethical Considerations. Please view the necessary documents from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation (https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-manual/) A list of links you can search and get data from: Note: I will not include the best links as they are pretty straightforward and these are governmental databases like the ones from World Bank, IMF, UN, Philippine Statistics Authority, and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The list here is a general list but use with proper discretion. Name Link Notes Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets Kaggle is where users can provide datasets; it is important to cite the sources. Mostly, datasets in Kaggle can be used for your practice. Awesome Public Datasets https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets This repository is filled with public datasets, mostly from International contexts. Google Dataset Search https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ You can download publicly available datasets from searching through Google. Though, sometimes the datasets come from ‘Statista.com’. You can check the sources from the search. 7.2 Preliminaries 7.2.1 Dataset The dataset to be used can be downloaded here: Chapter2 Practice and will be included in the Files in Animospace. The dataset was modified from the Wooldridge package in R as practice material. The particular dataset is the ‘htv’ dataset. #install the wooldridge package. Check previous chapter on how to install packages. load(wooldridge) ?htv #to find out about the particular dataset. NOTE: The htv dataset help will tell you what the variables mean, however, for our practice, we will use the modified version of this dataset. 7.2.2 Packages We will mostly use the tidyverse package, in particular, the dplyr package and the tidyr package; double-check in your Packages list whether you have these two packages; if not, you can simply install them. 7.2.3 Setting up the Directory This is the most important step! Make sure to place the downloaded file in this folder: DLSU_LBOMETR_Section in your laptops. Remember, this is your local working directory. This is the working directory you choose. You can set up your working directory in the following ways: Using the R Studio Menu (works for both Mac and Windows) a. Go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Working Directory Windows: # Use double backslashes `\\\\` or forward slashes `/` setwd(&quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\YourUsername\\\\Documents&quot;) # Example with backslashes setwd(&quot;C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents&quot;) # Example with forward slashes Mac # Use forward slashes `/` setwd(&quot;/Users/YourUsername/Documents&quot;) To check: getwd() 7.2.4 Clean Everything Do this step every time you use other data or when we do the other chapters. # Remove all objects in the global environment rm(list = ls()) # Perform garbage collection to free up memory gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 970266 51.9 1941064 103.7 1319291 70.5 ## Vcells 2360580 18.1 8388608 64.0 3274415 25.0 7.2.5 Importing the Dataset We can use the read.csv() to load the csv file into R. Always call the file as something short and easily understandable. Ensure the downloaded file is in the working directory before you load the file. If the downloaded file is not located in the working directory, you will encounter issues. I will name the file as ch2_p1 ch2_p1&lt;-read.csv(&quot;Ch2Practice.csv&quot;) We can use the head() function to inspect the first six rows of the dataset: head(ch2_p1) ## WAGE ABILITY EDUCATION NORTHEAST NORTHCENTRAL WEST SOUTH EXPERIENCE MOTHEREDUC ## 1 12.019231 5.027738 15 no no yes no 9 12 ## 2 8.912656 2.037170 13 yes no no no 8 12 ## 3 15.514334 2.475895 15 yes no no no 11 12 ## 4 13.333333 3.609240 15 yes no no no 6 12 ## 5 11.070110 2.636546 13 yes no no no 15 12 ## 6 17.482517 3.474334 18 yes no no no 8 12 ## FATHEREDUC BROKENHOME14 SIBLINGS URBAN X18INNORTHEAST X18INNORTHCENTRAL X18INSOUTH X18INWEST ## 1 12 0 1 yes 1 0 0 0 ## 2 10 1 4 yes 1 0 0 0 ## 3 16 0 2 yes 1 0 0 0 ## 4 12 0 1 yes 1 0 0 0 ## 5 15 1 2 yes 1 0 0 0 ## 6 12 0 2 yes 1 0 0 0 ## X18INURBAN X17TUITION X18TUITION LOGWAGE EXPER.2 ## 1 1 7.582914 7.260242 2.486508 81 ## 2 1 8.595144 9.499537 2.187472 64 ## 3 1 7.311346 7.311346 2.741764 121 ## 4 1 9.499537 10.162070 2.590267 36 ## 5 1 7.311346 7.311346 2.404249 225 ## 6 1 7.311346 7.311346 2.861201 64 7.3 Data Cleaning As you can see, there are 22 columns. Let’s simplify by only choosing the following: WAGE, URBAN, X17TUITION, X18TUITION and EXPER.2. We can do this using the select() function in dplyr. We will save them into a new data frame, ch2_p1.1. library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union ch2_p1.1&lt;-select(ch2_p1, #the original dataset WAGE, URBAN, X17TUITION, X18TUITION, EXPER.2) 7.3.1 Renaming the Variables We will edit the names to much easier conventions. First, let us say that we just want to change them to lowercase names. names(ch2_p1.1)&lt;-tolower(names(ch2_p1.1)) Inspect: head(ch2_p1.1) ## wage urban x17tuition x18tuition exper.2 ## 1 12.019231 yes 7.582914 7.260242 81 ## 2 8.912656 yes 8.595144 9.499537 64 ## 3 15.514334 yes 7.311346 7.311346 121 ## 4 13.333333 yes 9.499537 10.162070 36 ## 5 11.070110 yes 7.311346 7.311346 225 ## 6 17.482517 yes 7.311346 7.311346 64 Let us change the names of x17tuition, x18tuition,andexper.2 to the names similar to what is found in the ‘htv’ dataset: x17tuition to tuit17, x18tuition to tuit18 and exper.2 to expersq . To do this, we will use the rename() in dplyr. We will also use the (%&gt;%) for this. ch2_p1.1&lt;-ch2_p1.1 %&gt;% rename( tuit17 = x17tuition, tuit18 = x18tuition, expersq = exper.2 ) Inspect again: head(ch2_p1.1) ## wage urban tuit17 tuit18 expersq ## 1 12.019231 yes 7.582914 7.260242 81 ## 2 8.912656 yes 8.595144 9.499537 64 ## 3 15.514334 yes 7.311346 7.311346 121 ## 4 13.333333 yes 9.499537 10.162070 36 ## 5 11.070110 yes 7.311346 7.311346 225 ## 6 17.482517 yes 7.311346 7.311346 64 7.3.2 Sorting certain values Let’s say, we want to arrange wage. We will create a different data for this. We use arrange in dplyr package. ch2_p1sort&lt;-arrange(ch2_p1.1, wage) Inspect: head(ch2_p1sort) ## wage urban tuit17 tuit18 expersq ## 1 1.023529 yes 2.088957 2.251239 169 ## 2 1.073345 no 7.520245 7.520245 196 ## 3 1.102362 yes 7.355460 6.922371 196 ## 4 1.250000 yes 9.417682 8.826549 100 ## 5 1.373626 yes 9.692757 9.692757 225 ## 6 1.442308 no 11.280367 11.280367 NA What if you have this kind of data? head(ch2_p2) ## ch2_p2 ## 1 $10,000 ## 2 $20,500 ## 3 $15,250 ## 4 $30,000 ## 5 $50,750 Let’s sort this: ch2_p2sort&lt;-arrange(ch2_p2) head(ch2_p2) ## ch2_p2 ## 1 $10,000 ## 2 $20,500 ## 3 $15,250 ## 4 $30,000 ## 5 $50,750 It did not work. The problem is, ch2_p2 is not numeric. We can check: class(ch2_p2$ch2_p2) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; We need to make it into a numeric value but we have a , and $. We need to remove them. We use the str_replace function in the stringr package. library(stringr) ch2_p2$ch2_p2&lt;-str_replace( ch2_p2$ch2_p2, #column we want to edit pattern = &#39;,&#39;, #what to find replacement = &#39;&#39; #what to replace it with ) head(ch2_p2) ## ch2_p2 ## 1 $10000 ## 2 $20500 ## 3 $15250 ## 4 $30000 ## 5 $50750 Now, let us remove the dollar sign; usually, simply doing the same thing we did with the comma works, but, there are some symbols that are used as “special character”. To “force” R to replace the presence of ‘$’, we add two backslashes before the dollar sign. ch2_p2$ch2_p2&lt;-str_replace( ch2_p2$ch2_p2, pattern = &#39;\\\\$&#39;, replacement = &#39;&#39; ) Can you inspect it on your own? Simply type the code in the empty code chunk then run it by pressing Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter Now, sort ch2_p2 ch2_p2sort&lt;-arrange( ch2_p2, ch2_p2 ) head(ch2_p2sort) ## ch2_p2 ## 1 10000 ## 2 15250 ## 3 20500 ## 4 30000 ## 5 50750 We can see that it was arranged, however, take a look at the way ch2_p2 was encoded; it is not numeric. So, we need to change this. class(ch2_p2$ch2_p2) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Change to numeric through as.numeric() ch2_p2$ch2_p2&lt;-as.numeric(ch2_p2$ch2_p2) Inspect on your own: 7.3.3 Pipe Operator %&gt;% allows functions to be chained; it can be read as “then” - it tells R to do whatever comes after it to the stuff that comes before it. 7.3.4 Adding columns We will be using the pipe operator and the mutate to add a new column to ch2_p1.1 based from details found in ch2_p1, particularly, NORTHEAST, NORTHCENTRAL, WEST, and SOUTH. We will call this new column as location ch2_p1.1&lt;-ch2_p1.1 %&gt;% mutate( location = case_when( #creates conditional statements ch2_p1$NORTHEAST == &quot;yes&quot; ~ &quot;northeast&quot;, #If NE is &quot;yes&quot;, location is &quot;northeast&quot; ch2_p1$WEST == &quot;yes&quot;~&quot;west&quot;, #If WEST is &quot;yes&quot;, location is &quot;west&quot; ch2_p1$NORTHCENTRAL == &quot;yes&quot;~ &quot;northcen&quot;, ch2_p1$SOUTH == &quot;yes&quot;~ &quot;south&quot;, TRUE~&quot;other&quot;) ) Inspect the data: Now I want you to create a new column called, tuit_diff wherein it is the difference between tuit18 and tuit17. In this case, there is no need to use case_when since there is no conditional statements to be used. It is straightforward that you simply need to subtract tuit17 from tuit18. You will need to use mutate still. How will you create that? 7.3.5 Transforming values Now, you can see that urban is a character that is “yes/no”. We need to change that to numeric value. This is particularly useful when we use dummy variables later on. We will not use case_when as it is not necessary; rather, we will use ifelse: ch2_p1.1&lt;-ch2_p1.1 %&gt;% mutate( urban = ifelse(urban==&quot;yes&quot;, 1,0) #replace &quot;yes&quot; with 1 and &quot;no&quot; with 0 ) head(ch2_p1.1) #default is first 6 rows ## wage urban tuit17 tuit18 expersq location ## 1 12.019231 1 7.582914 7.260242 81 west ## 2 8.912656 1 8.595144 9.499537 64 northeast ## 3 15.514334 1 7.311346 7.311346 121 northeast ## 4 13.333333 1 9.499537 10.162070 36 northeast ## 5 11.070110 1 7.311346 7.311346 225 northeast ## 6 17.482517 1 7.311346 7.311346 64 northeast Now, I want you to create groups for expersq. NA should now be 0, assign 1 if less than 50, assign 2 if between 50 and 100, assign 3 if between 100 and 200, and for the rest, assign 4. Clue: conditional statements like between 50 and 100 should be like this: values&gt;=50 &amp; values &lt; 100 Your answer should look like this: ## wage urban tuit17 tuit18 expersq location ## 1 12.019231 1 7.582914 7.260242 2 west ## 2 8.912656 1 8.595144 9.499537 2 northeast ## 3 15.514334 1 7.311346 7.311346 3 northeast ## 4 13.333333 1 9.499537 10.162070 1 northeast ## 5 11.070110 1 7.311346 7.311346 4 northeast ## 6 17.482517 1 7.311346 7.311346 2 northeast 7.3.6 Summarizing Let us get the average of wages by location, which we’ll call ave.wage, by using the group_by() and summarise() functions in dplyr ch2_p1.1ave&lt;-ch2_p1.1 %&gt;% group_by(location) %&gt;% #group by location, THEN summarise(ave.wage=mean(wage)) #calculate the mean of wages for each location head(ch2_p1.1ave) ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## location ave.wage ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 northcen 12.5 ## 2 northeast 15.0 ## 3 south 12.4 ## 4 west 14.1 Say that you want to see the average wage in the south area. We can do this by using filter() ch2_p1.1ave %&gt;% filter(location==&quot;south&quot;) ## # A tibble: 1 × 2 ## location ave.wage ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 south 12.4 How would you sort the dataset by average wage, from highest to lowest? Now you see that it is arranged alphabetically, so how will you arrange it? 7.3.7 Merging datasets We have two main datasets, ch2_p1.1 and ch2_p1.1ave. By doing this, we could compare side-by-side each observation compared to the average per location. We will join the datasets by location variable, since that is consistent across both datasets. We name the new file as ch2_p1merged: ch2_p1merged&lt;-merge(x=ch2_p1.1, y=ch2_p1.1ave, by=&quot;location&quot;) head(ch2_p1merged) ## location wage urban tuit17 tuit18 expersq ave.wage ## 1 northcen 15.294118 1 8.334936 8.334936 3 12.54078 ## 2 northcen 17.006804 1 8.334936 8.334936 0 12.54078 ## 3 northcen 3.755868 1 8.334936 8.334936 3 12.54078 ## 4 northcen 5.288462 1 6.742574 7.198132 2 12.54078 ## 5 northcen 9.072165 1 7.305873 7.356897 0 12.54078 ## 6 northcen 9.384164 1 8.334936 8.334936 3 12.54078 7.3.8 Splitting datasets Say I want to save different datasets based on the location column. northcen_data&lt;-ch2_p1.1 %&gt;% filter(location==&quot;northcen&quot;) You can save it as a .csv file: write.csv(northcen_data, &quot;northcentral.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) Can you do the others? 7.3.9 Dates We are going to work on dates when we move to the next chapter but, here is something initial and necessary. ## ID date_of_birth ## 1 1 15-05-1990 ## 2 2 20-08-1985 ## 3 3 01-12-2000 ## 4 4 10-03-1995 ## 5 5 25-07-2010 ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 5 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ ID : int 1 2 3 4 5 ## $ date_of_birth: chr &quot;15-05-1990&quot; &quot;20-08-1985&quot; &quot;01-12-2000&quot; &quot;10-03-1995&quot; ... To convert the character format to date format, we do this: date_data$date_of_birth &lt;- as.Date(date_data$date_of_birth, format = &quot;%d-%m-%Y&quot;) head(date_data) ## ID date_of_birth ## 1 1 1990-05-15 ## 2 2 1985-08-20 ## 3 3 2000-12-01 ## 4 4 1995-03-10 ## 5 5 2010-07-25 Say you want to calculate the age: date_data$age &lt;-as.numeric(floor((Sys.Date()-date_data$date_of_birth)/365.25)) head(date_data) ## ID date_of_birth age ## 1 1 1990-05-15 35 ## 2 2 1985-08-20 39 ## 3 3 2000-12-01 24 ## 4 4 1995-03-10 30 ## 5 5 2010-07-25 14 7.3.9.1 Custom Reference Date: ref_date&lt;-as.Date(&quot;2020-01-01&quot;) date_data$age2&lt;-as.numeric(floor((ref_date-date_data$date_of_birth)/365.25)) head(date_data) ## ID date_of_birth age age2 ## 1 1 1990-05-15 35 29 ## 2 2 1985-08-20 39 34 ## 3 3 2000-12-01 24 19 ## 4 4 1995-03-10 30 24 ## 5 5 2010-07-25 14 9 7.4 Data Management Practical In your Quarto Markdown files, you need to answer the following questions. Answers will be given the week after the Practical as a form of Feedback. You can answer by group. It would be great to include which group member did what. In the first part of the practical, answer the following reflection: Do you think you were able to input correctly all the codes in the empty code chunks? Why do you think so? What did you find difficult? Now comes the practical proper: Using the kpop idols dataset which you download: Practical 1 - also made available in Animospace, answer the questions. Ensure that you can render individually before uploading in your shared Google Drive. Failure to render the file means you were unable to do the Practical. The leader must take note of this since accomplishing the practicals are part of your grade in Group Participation and the Data Story Archive. Separate the dataset into two datasets: one for males and one for females. Save these datasets as males.csv and females.csv Edit the column names for both males and females datasets to make them shorter, easier to understand, and consistent Remove the following columns from both datasets: Instagram, Korean Name, K.Stage Name, Stage Name How many males and females are in the dataset? Hint: nrow() Create a binary variable not_seoul for both datasets. Assign 1 if birthplace is not Seoul, and 0 otherwise Count how many individuals are from Seoul and how many are not for both datasets. How many males are eligible for military service (ages 18-28 as of February 27, 2024)? Filter the males dataset for this age range, how many from the Country of South Korea (only filter according to Country for straightforwardness) and count how many qualify. Assign generations based on age (as of June 29, 2023 when the Korean Age system was abolished) for both datasets. Generation criteria: 1st Gen: Age&gt;=40 2nd Gen: 31&lt;=Age&lt;=39 3rd Gen: 25&lt;=Age&lt;=30 4th Gen: Age&lt;=24 Count the number of individuals in each generation for males and females Create a new column income for both datasets using hypothetical values based from your hypothesis on age influencing income levels of idols. Explain first what your hypothesis is - are idols who are older earning more or less? Why or why not? Also think if you believe females earn more than males or vice versa? Use set.seed() for reproducibility and generate random income values. Please have different income values depending on their age. You can do similar groupings as Step 7 for this. Compare the mean income Combine the males and females datasets Calculate the income difference between males and females Create a column income_diff to calculate how much more or less each individual’s income is compared to the average income of the other gender. Save the final dataset named Ch2_Practical_Section_GrpNo.csv 7.5 Data Management (Cross-Sectional) Feedback This feedback will contain only what the answers should look like and some clues and hints.

Now, I will introduce you to the cat function, The cat function will print in the result some text and what will be seen when you include the object you created that reveals the number of males (or females). We should all have the same number. If not, something is wrong. #cat(&quot;Number of males:&quot;, nummale,&quot;\\n&quot;) ## Number of males: 843 ## Number of females: 823 Create a binary variable not_seoul Here, create a new column for not_seoul in both males and females. Use ifelse and the statement should include != Count Individuals from and not from Seoul I introduce the count function. Simply add count after choosing the dataset. So, the code is choose males THEN count those that are not_seoul. We should have the same number. ## Males from Seoul and not Seoul: ## From Seoul: 98 ## Not from Seoul: 745 ## Females from Seoul and not Seoul: ## From Seoul: 108 ## Not from Seoul: 715 Filter Males Eligible for Military Service Use reference date and when you filter, you can actually combine filtering the Age to be: Age&gt;= 18, Age&lt;=28, Country == \"South Korea\". We should have the same number. ## Number of males eligible for military service: 496 Assign Generations Based on Age We should have the same numbers. If you have created an Age column for males before, you cannot use that for this number since the reference dates are different. You need to create a new column for Age for both males and females. ## Generation distribution for males: ## 1st Gen: 8 ## 2nd Gen: 137 ## 3rd Gen: 358 ## 4th Gen: 340 ## Generation distribution for females: ## 1st Gen: 4 ## 2nd Gen: 131 ## 3rd Gen: 302 ## 4th Gen: 386 Create Income Column Based on Hypothesis My hypothesis is that older idols earn more since they have been in the industry much longer. I also hypothesize that females earn less than males. I introduce a new function here, it is the runif(n(), value, value). This function is to just create income values which will be in-line with the number of rows in the dataset. However, I am amenable in any strategy you employ to generate income here. I just need to know your hypothesis and how you plan to do the income column. In fact, if you want, you can even create the income column in Excel already. Just let me know. Another strategy is to still do case_when and have smaller increments in Age then have income values. Another, have the same income for each generation, that is also fine. Again, this is for practice purposes. # Generate income values based on age group directly set.seed(123) # For reproducibility males &lt;- males %&gt;% mutate(Income = case_when( Age2 &gt;= 40 ~ runif(n(), 50000, 70000), # 1st Gen Age2 &gt;= 31 &amp; Age2 &lt;= 39 ~ runif(n(), 40000, 60000), # 2nd Gen Age2 &gt;= 25 &amp; Age2 &lt;= 30 ~ runif(n(), 30000, 50000), # 3rd Gen Age2 &lt;= 24 ~ runif(n(), 20000, 40000) # 4th Gen )) females &lt;- females %&gt;% mutate(Income = case_when( Age2 &gt;= 40 ~ runif(n(), 50000, 70000), # 1st Gen Age2 &gt;= 31 &amp; Age2 &lt;= 39 ~ runif(n(), 40000, 60000), # 2nd Gen Age2 &gt;= 25 &amp; Age2 &lt;= 30 ~ runif(n(), 30000, 50000), # 3rd Gen Age2 &lt;= 24 ~ runif(n(), 20000, 40000) # 4th Gen )) Combine datasets So, I taught you how to merge the datasets. You can do that as well, however, it is important to determine which came from the males, which came from the females so, you need to create a new column in the males and the females that would include the Gender. I also show a different way of merging datasets. I use bind_rows since males and females have the same columns. However, if you view the combined dataset, you will notice that the females will appear after the males. This is fine. # Ensure column names match and add a Gender column males &lt;- males %&gt;% mutate(Gender = &quot;Male&quot;) females &lt;- females %&gt;% mutate(Gender = &quot;Female&quot;) # Combine the datasets combined &lt;- bind_rows(males, females) # View the combined dataset View(combined) Calculate the Income Difference I use the group_by function and the summarise function. I got the Mean and the Median. Later on, I will discuss the difference between getting the mean and the median or when best to use the mean or the median. ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## Gender Mean_Income Median_Income ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female 36858. 36414. ## 2 Male 37907. 37246. ## The gender with the higher mean income is: Male ## The gender with the higher median income is: Male Now that we have the combined dataset, simply save it as a CSV file and you are done with the practical.

We need to convert it to the Date class. We also need to do this to a copy of the raw data for further modifications. ch3_p1.1&lt;-ch3_p1 head(ch3_p1.1$ds) ## [1] &quot;2015-06-13&quot; &quot;2015-06-14&quot; &quot;2015-06-15&quot; &quot;2015-06-16&quot; &quot;2015-06-17&quot; &quot;2015-06-18&quot; class(ch3_p1.1$ds) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ch3_p1.1$ds &lt;- as.Date(ch3_p1.1$ds, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) class(ch3_p1.1$ds) ## [1] &quot;Date&quot; 8.2.3 Aggregate Data We now have daily data. Say we want to create weekly data, we use the cut function to group dates by week, month, quarter and year. Since we know for sure that the date column is in date format, no need to check, however, it is always useful to check the class of date. 8.2.3.1 Aggregate by Week Add new columns for each aggregation. ch3_p1.1$week&lt;-cut(ch3_p1.1$ds, breaks = &quot;week&quot;) The cut is used to divide the date into intervals while the breaks specifies that the date be divided into weekly intervals. Check creation of the week column head(ch3_p1.1) ## ds y week ## 1 2015-06-13 232.402 2015-06-08 ## 2 2015-06-14 233.543 2015-06-08 ## 3 2015-06-15 236.823 2015-06-15 ## 4 2015-06-16 250.895 2015-06-15 ## 5 2015-06-17 249.284 2015-06-15 ## 6 2015-06-18 249.007 2015-06-15 Since we have the y column which is actually Bitcoin Price, we need to aggregate that weekly using the aggregate function week_y&lt;-aggregate(. ~ week, #refers to all other columns in the dataset and groups them by week data=ch3_p1.1, FUN = mean #specifies that the mean function should be applied to the numeric column within each week ) You will notice that this creates a separate data frame. We will merge week_y with ch3_p1.1 ch3_p1.1&lt;-merge(ch3_p1.1, week_y, by = &quot;week&quot;, #ensures the merge aligns based on the week suffixes = c(&quot;&quot;,&quot;_weekly&quot;)) #adds _weekly to the column name to distinguish them from the original columns We will slightly do the same thing when aggregating by month, quarter and year. I will do the initial steps, but please do the succeeding steps on your own. 8.2.3.2 Aggregate by Month # Add a month column ch3_p1.1$month &lt;- format(ch3_p1.1$ds, &quot;%Y-%m&quot;) # Calculate monthly means month_y &lt;- aggregate(. ~ month, data = ch3_p1.1, FUN = mean) 8.2.3.3 Aggregate by Quarter This is different since we will use the paste0 and the format functions. The format function extracts the year from the date and extracts the quarter from the date. The paste0 combines the year and quarter without a space between them so that it results in which quarter of which year. ch3_p1.1$quarter &lt;- paste0(format(ch3_p1.1$ds, &quot;%Y&quot;), &quot; &quot;, quarters(ch3_p1.1$ds)) 8.2.3.4 Aggregate by Year ch3_p1.1$year&lt;-format(ch3_p1.1$ds, &quot;%Y&quot;) Can you aggregate the Bitcoin values on your own? 8.3 Modifying Long and Wide Datasets 8.3.1 How to Determine Aspect Long Format Wide Format Rows Each row represents a single observation (or measurement) Each row represents an entity (like a group) Columns Variables are split into multiple rows Variables are spread across multiple columns Compactness More rows, fewer columns Fewer rows, more columns 8.3.1.1 Examples of Long and Wide Formats 8.3.1.1.1 1.

We will need set.seed for reproducibility when you want to run the entire code again and to generate random values, we will use the rnorm function. set.seed(123) #Generate a long dataset long&lt;-data.frame( id = rep(1:5, each = 3), #creates 5 groups and repeated 3 times each variable = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), times=5), #Variables A,B,C are created and repeated 5 times value = rnorm(15, mean = 50, sd = 10) #creates random values for 15 observations with mean 50 and standard deviation of 10 ) print(long) ## id variable value ## 1 1 A 44.39524 ## 2 1 B 47.69823 ## 3 1 C 65.58708 ## 4 2 A 50.70508 ## 5 2 B 51.29288 ## 6 2 C 67.15065 ## 7 3 A 54.60916 ## 8 3 B 37.34939 ## 9 3 C 43.13147 ## 10 4 A 45.54338 ## 11 4 B 62.24082 ## 12 4 C 53.59814 ## 13 5 A 54.00771 ## 14 5 B 51.10683 ## 15 5 C 44.44159 8.3.2.2 Converting Long to Wide Format We will use the pivot_wider() function from the tidyr package. library(tidyr) wide&lt;-pivot_wider( data = long, names_from = variable, #Columns to become new column names values_from = value #Values to put under new columns ) print(wide) ## # A tibble: 5 × 4 ## id A B C ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 44.4 47.7 65.6 ## 2 2 50.7 51.3 67.2 ## 3 3 54.6 37.3 43.1 ## 4 4 45.5 62.2 53.6 ## 5 5 54.0 51.1 44.4 8.3.2.3 Convert Wide to Long We will use the converted wide dataset for this.

However, this method needs to have numeric format. ch3_p2.5&lt;-ch3_p2 for(col in names(ch3_p2.5)){ if(is.numeric(ch3_p2.5[[col]])) {#Check if column is numeric ch3_p2.5[[col]][is.na(ch3_p2.5[[col]])]&lt;-mean(ch3_p2.5[[col]], na.rm=TRUE) } } print(ch3_p2.5) ## id var1 var2 var3 ## 1 1 10.00000 30 44.39524 ## 2 2 26.66667 15 47.69823 ## 3 3 30.00000 25 65.58708 ## 4 4 40.00000 35 50.70508 ## 5 5 26.66667 45 51.29288 8.4.5 Note: When doing the three methods, there are pros and cons. Replacing with Zero can introduce bias if 0 is not realistic in the context of the data Remove Missing Values can result in significant data loss Imputing the Mean assumes the data is evenly distributed and can distort the variability in the data Always make sure you should understand your data. 8.4.6 Best Practice: Always explore and visualize patterns first. Leading to… 8.4.7 Next Meeting: Visualizing the data with base R package 8.4.8 Final Note: No Practical for this session; please work on the previous practical and the research problem to be submitted on January 24. Next week, we will have a computer practical. "],["visualizations-using-ggplot2.html", "9 Visualizations using ggplot2 9.1 Preliminaries 9.2 Visualizing Data using geom 9.3 Visualizing Time Series Data 9.4 Practical: Visualizations 9.5 Feedback: Practical Visualizations", " 9 Visualizations using ggplot2 For this lecture, we will be using ggplot2 package. Please make sure that you have it installed. The package works best with data in the ‘long’ format so it helps to modify the dataset to this format rather than a wide format. 9.1 Preliminaries 9.1.1 Load the dataset The dataset can be downloaded from the Modules. We will use Ch4PracticeA for this portion of the discussion. Unlike previous datasets that we loaded, we are now loading an Excel file. We will need the readxl package for this. Also, it is important to check if there are additional sheets and which sheet you will need. There are actually two sheets in the Excel file, but we will only use the first sheet named base. rm(list=ls()) gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 1340114 71.6 2442802 130.5 1941064 103.7 ## Vcells 3075958 23.5 8388608 64.0 4319600 33.0 library(readxl) ch4_p1 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;Ch4PracticeA.xlsx&quot;, sheet = &quot;base&quot;) I will not delve deeply in the description. Please read up on it. The description can be found in the last sheet of the Excel file. Next, we load the following package: tidyverse library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ── ## ✔ forcats 1.0.0 ✔ readr 2.1.5 ## ✔ ggplot2 3.5.1 ✔ tibble 3.2.1 ## ✔ purrr 1.0.2 ## ── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors 9.1.2 Template There is a basic template that can be used for different types of plots: &lt;DATA&gt; %&gt;% ggplot(aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;))+ &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;() ggplot is a function that expects a data frame to be the first argument. This allows for us to change from specifying the data = argument within the ggplot function and instead pipe the data into the function. Use the ggplot() function… ch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot() Now, we define the mapping (using the aesthetic (aes) function), by selecting the variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc. ch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=poverty_index, y=health_expenditures)) The next step is to add geom which will make the graphical representations of the data. These include: geom_point() for scatter plots, dot plots, etc. geom_boxplot() for boxplots geom_line() for trend lines, time series, etc. geom_bar() for bar plots and pie charts 9.2 Visualizing Data using geom 9.2.1 Scatterplots Let us use the geom_point() first then we will do the others after. Also, scatterplots are useful when you want to display the relationship between two continuous variables. Can you give me an example of when to use scatterplots? ch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=poverty_index, y=health_expenditures)) + geom_point() This visualization is so unclear; this is due to the number of observations being more than 9,000. Let’s just use the first 500 rows as this is for our practice and for visualization purposes. fch4_p1 &lt;- head(ch4_p1, 500) View(fch4_p1) This is more manageable; let’s try the scatterplot again, this time using the fch4_p1 dataset. fch4_p1%&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=poverty_index, y=health_expenditures)) + geom_point() This is more visible; There are some points that overlap with each other. Let us incorporate some strategies to try and ensure that there will be no overplotting issues. The first strategy is changing the transparency of the points. To control the transparency of points, we add the alpha argument. The range of transparency is from 0 to 1, with lower values corresponding to more transparency. The default value is 1. Let’s try to change the alpha to 0.5. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=poverty_index, y=health_expenditures)) + geom_point(alpha=0.5) Some of the points are gray while the others are much darker, then we can see (slightly) the difference. Another method that we can do is jittering the points on the plot to see the locations where there are overplotting points. Jittering adds randomness into the position of the points. To do this, we add geom_jitter() rather than geom_point(). Also, we need to edit the width and height. You can experiment but if you want less spread, pick values between 0.1 and 0.4. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=poverty_index, y=health_expenditures)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width= 0.3, height= 0.3) Let us add color to geom_jitter() fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=poverty_index, y=health_expenditures)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = &quot;darkgreen&quot;, width= 0.3, height= 0.3) If you want to have different colors depending on a certain variable, we need to use a vector as an input in the argument color. Here though, we map features of the data to a certain color. When we map a variable in our data to the color of the points, ggplot2 will provide a different color corresponding to the different values of the variable. We will continue to specify the value of alpha, width, and height outside of the aes function because we are using the same value for every point. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=poverty_index, y=health_expenditures))+ geom_jitter(aes(color=as.factor(enrolled)), #this is because the enrolled is of num type. To make it categorical, we need to change to as.factor. You can do this before placing it in the aes to remove the &#39;as.factor&#39; in the legend alpha=0.5, width=0.3, height=0.3) 9.2.2 Boxplots Here is how to make a box plot that is useful when summarizing the distribution of a continuous variable, highlighting the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. To interpret a boxplot, take note of the following things: Horizontal Line in the Box: this is the median wherein it represents the 50% of the data. The Box Itself: The box represents the middle 50% of the data, the bottom of the box represent first quartile so 25% of the data falls below this value, and the top of the box represent the third quartile so 75% of the data falls below this value. Whiskers extend from the box to represent the range of the data excluding outliers so it usually end at the smallest and largest data points. Outliers are points outside the whiskers. *The labs argument is to add labels in the plot. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(treatment_locality), y = health_expenditures)) + geom_boxplot(fill = &quot;green&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Box Plot: Health Expenditures by Treatment Locality&quot;, x = &quot;Treatment Locality&quot;, y = &quot;Health Expenditures&quot;) + theme_minimal() You can also add some points in the box plot by adding geom_jitter fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(treatment_locality), y = health_expenditures)) + geom_boxplot(fill=&quot;green&quot;) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = &quot;tomato&quot;, width = 0.2, height = 0.2) + labs(title = &quot;Box Plot: Health Expenditures by Treatment Locality&quot;, x = &quot;Treatment Locality&quot;, y = &quot;Health Expenditures&quot;) + theme_minimal() 9.2.3 Bar plots Barplots are also useful for visualizing categorical data. By default, geom_bar accepts a variable for x, and plots the number of instances each value of x (in this case, treatment_locality) appears in the dataset. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(treatment_locality))) + geom_bar(fill = &quot;lightgreen&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Bar Plot: Count of Localities by Treatment Locality&quot;, x = &quot;Treatment Locality&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;) + theme_minimal() Let us change the fill to be locality_identifier. Note, we will have a lot of colors here but this is done for visualization purposes and practice. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(treatment_locality), fill = as.factor(locality_identifier))) + geom_bar() + labs(title = &quot;Bar Plot: Count of Localities by Treatment Locality and Locality&quot;, x = &quot;Treatment Locality&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;, fill = &quot;Locality&quot;) + theme_minimal() This creates a stacked bar chart. These are generally more difficult to read than side-by-side bars. We can separate the portions of the stacked bar that correspond to each village and put them side-by-side by using the position argument for geom_bar() and setting it to “dodge”. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(treatment_locality), fill = as.factor(locality_identifier))) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Bar Plot: Count of Localities by Treatment Locality and Locality&quot;, x = &quot;Treatment Locality&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;, fill = &quot;Locality&quot;) + theme_minimal() 9.2.4 Faceting ggplot2 has a special technique called faceting that allows the user to split one plot into multiple plots based on a factor included in the dataset. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = poverty_index, y = health_expenditures)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = &quot;darkblue&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ locality_identifier, ncol = 4) + labs(title = &quot;Faceted Scatter Plot by Locality Identifier&quot;, x = &quot;Poverty Index&quot;, y = &quot;Health Expenditures&quot;) + theme_minimal() It doesn’t look that nice; let’s group the locality_identifier to make it more visually appealing: fch4_p1 &lt;- fch4_p1 %&gt;% mutate(locality_group = cut(locality_identifier, breaks = c(20, 40, 60, 80, 100), labels = c(&quot;20-40&quot;, &quot;40-60&quot;, &quot;60-80&quot;, &quot;80-100&quot;), include.lowest = TRUE)) table(fch4_p1$locality_group) ## ## 20-40 40-60 60-80 80-100 ## 197 42 66 51 fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = poverty_index, y = health_expenditures)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = &quot;darkgreen&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ locality_group, ncol = 4) + labs(title = &quot;Faceted Scatter Plot by Locality Identifier&quot;, x = &quot;Poverty Index&quot;, y = &quot;Health Expenditures&quot;) + theme_minimal() 9.2.5 Pie Chart Pie charts are used to illustrate proportions or parts of a whole (limited to a small number of categories). Before we do the pie chart, we need to count how many observations there are in the variable we want to analyze. treatment_counts &lt;- fch4_p1 %&gt;% count(treatment_locality) ggplot(treatment_counts, aes(x = &quot;&quot;, y = n, fill = as.factor(treatment_locality))) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, width = 1) + coord_polar(theta = &quot;y&quot;) + #this makes it a pie chart labs(title = &quot;Pie Chart: Proportion of Treatment Localities&quot;, fill = &quot;Treatment Locality&quot;) + theme_void() #another way to have a nice background 9.2.6 Histogram Though it looks similar to a bar plot, a histogram is different since it displays the distribution of a continuous variable. It groups the data into intervals called bins and shows the frequency of data points within each bin. fch4_p1 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=poverty_index))+ geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill=&quot;green&quot;, color=&quot;black&quot;)+ theme_minimal() Here is a cheat sheet for ggplot2 from the ones who developed the package: ggplot2 Cheat Sheet 9.3 Visualizing Time Series Data When visualizing time series data, it is important to ensure that the time variable is formatted as Date. For this portion of the lecture, we use Ch4PracticeB.xlsx which is found in the Modules. Make sure to clean the environment, load the file and rename the columns since they are quite long. I will not show the codes for this portion anymore as I am sure you already know how. ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 1691093 90.4 2971362 158.7 2442802 130.5 ## Vcells 3691130 28.2 8388608 64.0 6868598 52.5 ## # A tibble: 6 × 12 ## year nominal_gdp_current nominal_gdp_constant gdp_growth_current gdp_growth_constant ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1986 692852 4298952 0.065 0.035 ## 2 1987 777283 4486464 0.122 0.044 ## 3 1988 910280 4786920 0.171 0.067 ## 4 1989 1054529 5082939 0.158 0.062 ## 5 1990 1227882 5239629 0.164 0.031 ## 6 1991 1422958 5216764 0.159 -0.004 ## # ℹ 7 more variables: total_debt &lt;dbl&gt;, debt_to_gdp &lt;dbl&gt;, interest_payments &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # amortization_payments &lt;dbl&gt;, phil_us_exchange_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, inflation &lt;dbl&gt;, fdi_net &lt;dbl&gt; Ensure the time variable is formatted as Date I will not show the code for this since this has been done in previous lectures Template To make a time series visualization, this is the template: ggplot(data, aes(x = time_variable, y = value_variable)) + geom_line(color = &quot;blue&quot;) + #adds a trend line labs(title = &quot;Time Series Plot&quot;, x = &quot;Time&quot;, y = &quot;Value&quot;) + theme_minimal() Time Series Plot You might wonder why mine does not have a warning. Usually, there will be warnings that will come out. To remove it, simply add inside the {r}, warning=FALSE like: {r,warning=FALSE} ch4_p2 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=nominal_gdp_current))+ geom_line(color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;)+ labs(title = &quot;Time Series Plot of Nominal GDP (Current)&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Nominal GDP (Current)&quot;) + theme_minimal() We can add points for clarity. ch4_p2 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=nominal_gdp_current))+ geom_line(color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;)+ geom_point(color= &quot;pink&quot;)+ labs(title = &quot;Time Series Plot of Nominal GDP (Current)&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Nominal GDP (Current)&quot;) 9.4 Practical: Visualizations For this practical, we will use the quotas dataset. Please read the quotas_codebook to understand what each column means. Both files are found in the modules. Inspect the dataset by using str() and summary() and describe the types of variables available. Plot a histogram of the total population (tot_pop71_true). Adjust the number of bins to 15. What does this tell you about the distribution of population sizes in 1971? Plot a bar plot of the count of Assembly Constituencies (AC_type_noST) based on reservation status. Which category has the highest count? Plot the literacy rates (Plit71) against employment rates (P_W71). Add a regression line using geom_smooth(). What relationship do you observe? Add color to the scatter plot by using color to distinguish between different reservation statuses (AC_type_noST). How do the patterns differ across groups? Create a box plot of literacy rates (Plit71) for different reservation statuses (AC_type_noST). What do you notice about the spread of literacy rates across categories? Create a faceted scatter plot of literacy rates (Plit71) vs. employment rates (P_W71), grouped by reservation status (AC_type_noST). What differences can you identify between the facets? Create a pie chart showing the proportion of constituencies by reservation status (AC_type_noST). What does this chart reveal about the dataset? What did you find most challenging or rewarding about working with this dataset? Which visualization techniques did you find most useful for communicating your insights? For the time series plot, I want you to search the Literacy rate, adult total (% of people ages 15 and above)from the World Bank. I want you to download as CSV the data. Then, I want you to choose India only. Create a time series plot for India. 9.5 Feedback: Practical Visualizations For the Quarto Markdown files, you can include texts, like you are just regularly typing in Word. Only have the codes in code chunks then the analysis as text, rather than as comments. Use str() and summary() by loading necessary libraries: ggplot2 and dplyr ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3134 obs. of 21 variables: ## $ State_number_2001: int 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... ## $ AC_no_2001 : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ AC_number_1976 : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ State_name_1976 : chr &quot;Himachal Pradesh &quot; &quot;Himachal Pradesh &quot; &quot;Himachal Pradesh &quot; &quot;Himachal Pradesh &quot; ... ## $ AC_name_1976 : chr &quot;Kinnaur&quot; &quot;Rampur&quot; &quot;Rohru&quot; &quot;Jubbal-Kotkhai&quot; ... ## $ AC_type_noST : chr NA &quot;SC&quot; &quot;GEN&quot; &quot;GEN&quot; ... ## $ tot_pop71_true : int 49835 56788 58969 50083 46745 53083 47237 55368 51571 46816 ... ## $ SC_percent71_true: num 19.4 33.1 29.5 24.7 28.9 ... ## $ Plit71 : num 27.7 25.7 18.9 30.8 18.5 ... ## $ Plit71_SC : num 14.07 13.67 5.64 18.19 11.15 ... ## $ P_W71 : num 60.5 52.3 34.1 50.7 60.1 ... ## $ P_al71_SC : num 12.4 1.65 6.98 8.06 2.89 ... ## $ P_al71_nonSC : num 4.29 1.05 8.29 8.17 1.61 ... ## $ P_elecVD01 : num 100 100 98.3 100 100 ... ## $ P_elecVD01_sc : num 100 100 97.8 100 100 ... ## $ P_educVD01 : num 93.1 92.9 86.9 72.2 79.1 ... ## $ P_educVD01_sc : num 94.8 95.8 87.4 74 79 ... ## $ P_medicVD01 : num 60.4 44.4 34 27.1 25.7 ... ## $ P_medicVD01_sc : num 58.7 48.7 32.9 29.9 25.4 ... ## $ P_commVD01 : num 94.7 70.9 74.7 91.9 52 ... ## $ P_commVD01_sc : num 90.2 71.8 77.3 91.8 54 ... ## State_number_2001 AC_no_2001 AC_number_1976 State_name_1976 AC_name_1976 ## Min. : 2.00 Min. : 1.0 Min. : 1.00 Length:3134 Length:3134 ## 1st Qu.: 9.00 1st Qu.: 49.0 1st Qu.: 56.25 Class :character Class :character ## Median :22.00 Median :101.0 Median :117.00 Mode :character Mode :character ## Mean :19.47 Mean :119.5 Mean :133.50 ## 3rd Qu.:28.00 3rd Qu.:178.0 3rd Qu.:197.00 ## Max. :33.00 Max. :403.0 Max. :419.00 ## ## AC_type_noST tot_pop71_true SC_percent71_true Plit71 Plit71_SC ## Length:3134 Min. : 27568 Min. : 0.2017 Min. : 2.742 Min. : 1.966 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:133962 1st Qu.: 8.9001 1st Qu.:18.689 1st Qu.: 8.048 ## Mode :character Median :151681 Median :14.7556 Median :25.720 Median :13.305 ## Mean :154329 Mean :15.2454 Mean :28.525 Mean :16.304 ## 3rd Qu.:174641 3rd Qu.:20.0968 3rd Qu.:35.787 3rd Qu.:21.488 ## Max. :242840 Max. :66.5320 Max. :78.294 Max. :66.887 ## ## P_W71 P_al71_SC P_al71_nonSC P_elecVD01 P_elecVD01_sc ## Min. :21.66 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 ## 1st Qu.:28.93 1st Qu.:32.08 1st Qu.:10.66 1st Qu.: 89.02 1st Qu.: 90.53 ## Median :32.24 Median :51.61 Median :21.12 Median : 99.54 Median : 99.78 ## Mean :33.20 Mean :49.74 Mean :21.67 Mean : 89.15 Mean : 89.70 ## 3rd Qu.:36.72 3rd Qu.:68.02 3rd Qu.:30.91 3rd Qu.:100.00 3rd Qu.:100.00 ## Max. :60.52 Max. :92.88 Max. :66.69 Max. :100.00 Max. :100.00 ## NA&#39;s :58 NA&#39;s :58 ## P_educVD01 P_educVD01_sc P_medicVD01 P_medicVD01_sc P_commVD01 ## Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 ## 1st Qu.: 93.54 1st Qu.: 93.65 1st Qu.: 39.97 1st Qu.: 39.99 1st Qu.: 54.20 ## Median : 98.26 Median : 98.60 Median : 60.53 Median : 61.55 Median : 74.72 ## Mean : 95.03 Mean : 95.24 Mean : 61.05 Mean : 61.42 Mean : 71.88 ## 3rd Qu.: 99.86 3rd Qu.: 99.99 3rd Qu.: 83.22 3rd Qu.: 83.86 3rd Qu.: 93.84 ## Max. :100.00 Max. :100.00 Max. :100.00 Max. :100.00 Max. :100.00 ## NA&#39;s :58 NA&#39;s :58 NA&#39;s :58 NA&#39;s :58 NA&#39;s :58 ## P_commVD01_sc ## Min. : 0.00 ## 1st Qu.: 54.51 ## Median : 76.40 ## Mean : 72.70 ## 3rd Qu.: 94.44 ## Max. :100.00 ## NA&#39;s :58 Plot a histogram of the total population (tot_pop71_true).

Steps include: Loading the dataset Filtering the dataset to just include India Analyze the data; you will notice that it is in the wide dataset; it is therefore important to modify the dataset to long dataset for visualization Before doing the visualization, also notice that the time has a character “X” and some of the literacy rate does not have any data. Remove the “X” and the “NA” library(tidyr) library(dplyr) # Load the dataset world_bank_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;API_SE.ADT.LITR.ZS_DS2_en_csv_v2_160.csv&quot;, skip = 4) # Filter data for India india_data &lt;- world_bank_data %&gt;% filter(`Country.Name` == &quot;India&quot;) # Convert wide format to long format india_long &lt;- india_data %&gt;% select(-c(`Country.Code`, `Indicator.Name`, `Indicator.Code`)) %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -`Country.Name`, names_to = &quot;Year&quot;, values_to = &quot;Literacy Rate&quot;) #  Remove &quot;X&quot; prefix from Year and convert to numeric india_long$Year &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;&quot;, india_long$Year)) # Remove missing values india_long &lt;- india_long %&gt;% filter(!is.na(`Literacy Rate`)) ggplot(india_long, aes(x = Year, y = `Literacy Rate`)) + geom_line(color = &quot;darkgreen&quot;, size = 1) + geom_point(color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 2) + labs(title = &quot;India&#39;s Literacy Rate Over Time&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Literacy Rate (%)&quot;) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0. ## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead. ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.

Please do this before our lecture as it will take a long time to install them. Furthermore, there might be issues in installing, such as needing to install other packages. Please let the professor know if you encounter any issues. # Install necessary packages if (!require(gganimate)) install.packages(&quot;gganimate&quot;) ## Loading required package: gganimate if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) if (!require(dplyr)) install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) if (!require(sf)) install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) ## Loading required package: sf ## Linking to GEOS 3.12.2, GDAL 3.9.3, PROJ 9.4.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE if (!require(rnaturalearth)) install.packages(&quot;rnaturalearth&quot;) ## Loading required package: rnaturalearth if (!require(readr)) install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;) if (!require(tidyr)) install.packages(&quot;tidyr&quot;) if (!require(gifski)) install.packages(&quot;gifski&quot;) ## Loading required package: gifski if (!require(WDI)) install.packages(&quot;WDI&quot;) ## Loading required package: WDI if (!require(leaflet)) install.packages(&quot;leaflet&quot;) ## Loading required package: leaflet #Load packages library(gganimate) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(sf) library(rnaturalearth) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(gifski) library(WDI) library(leaflet) 10.2 Animated Visualizations gganimate includes animation to ggplot2; It adds some classes to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time. transition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time. view_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation. shadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time. enter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation. ease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions For this lecture, we will use the quotas dataset and fetch some World Bank Development Indicators from the WDI package. 10.2.1 Animated Bar Chart At the start, you need to do the same steps as that of when doing the visualizations without animations. rm(list = ls()) gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 3592804 191.9 6611092 353.1 4892275 261.3 ## Vcells 6467178 49.4 12255594 93.6 9075263 69.3 # Load the dataset quotas &lt;- read.csv(&quot;quotas.csv&quot;) ch5.1&lt;-quotas %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=factor(AC_type_noST)))+ geom_bar(fill=&quot;darkgreen&quot;, color=&quot;black&quot;)+ labs(title = &quot;Animated Bar Chart: Assembly Constituencies&quot;, x=&quot;Reservation Status&quot;, y=&quot;Count&quot;)+ theme_minimal()+ transition_states(AC_type_noST, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) The transition_states animates transitions between different categorical states. The AC_type_noST is the categorical variable that defines different animation states. The transition_length controls how long the transition between states lasts, measured in animation frames. While the state_length defines how long each state remains static before transitioning to the next one. 10.2.1.1 Saving and Embedding Animation This is very important; it is different for Quarto where the gif is automatically rendered; however, later, we will find out how to save in Quarto. anim_file &lt;- &quot;bar_chart.gif&quot; animate(ch5.1, duration = 4, fps = 10, renderer = gifski_renderer(anim_file), preview = TRUE) # Preview the animation before rendering # Save animation as a GIF knitr::include_graphics(anim_file) The animate function generates the animation of the ggplot object ch5.1. duration = 4: Specifies that the animation should run for 4 seconds in total. fps = 10: Defines the frame rate, meaning the animation will show 10 frames per second. renderer = gifski_renderer(anim_file): Uses the gifski_renderer to save the animation as a GIF file named bar_chart.gif. preview = TRUE: Allows you to view the animation immediately in the RStudio Viewer before saving it as a file. 10.2.2 Animated Scatter Plot ch5.2&lt;-quotas %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Plit71, y=P_W71))+ geom_point(aes(color=factor(AC_type_noST)))+ labs(title=&quot;Animated Scatter Plot: Literacy vs. Employment&quot;, x=&quot;Literacy Rate (1971)&quot;, y=&quot;Employment Rate (1971)&quot;, color=&quot;Reservation Status&quot;)+ theme_minimal()+ transition_reveal(Plit71) Here, the transition_reveal animates the points to be revealed over literacy rates 10.2.2.1 Saving and Embedding Animation anim_file2&lt;-&quot;scatter_plot.gif&quot; animate(ch5.2, duration=20, fps=10, renderer=gifski_renderer(anim_file2), preview=TRUE) knitr::include_graphics(anim_file2) To slow down the animation, increase the duration and decrease fps. 10.2.3 Animated Faceted Scatter Plot 10.2.3.1 Fetching WDI Data For this portion, we will make use of the WDI database. To search which indicator you wish to work with, type WDIsearch(\"keyword\") ch5&lt;-WDI( country = c(&quot;USA&quot;,&quot;CHN&quot;, &quot;IND&quot;, &quot;BRA&quot;,&quot;NLD&quot;, &quot;JPN&quot;), indicator = c(&quot;NY.GDP.PCAP.CD&quot;, &quot;SP.DYN.LE00.IN&quot;), start = 2000, end = 2020, extra = TRUE ) This code chunk pulls data from the World Bank WDI database of 6 countries and two indicators (GDP per capita (current US$) and Life Expectancy at Birth (years).

The rnaturalearth provides some shapefiles you can use. A suggested site to find shapefiles of different countries: https://gadm.org/index.html . You can also locate shapefiles from the government sites. We will make use of the packages like WDI, rnaturalearth,sf, gganimate, and leaflet. Do note however, that gganimate and leaflet does not work for PDF, thus, it can only be used for your Data Story Presentation. 10.6 Static Maps 10.6.1 Fetching GDP Data from WDI rm(list=ls()) gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 3657690 195.4 6611092 353.1 4892275 261.3 ## Vcells 7244882 55.3 14786712 112.9 11071623 84.5 ch5_2&lt;-WDI(country = &quot;all&quot;, indicator = &quot;NY.GDP.MKTP.CD&quot;, start = 2000, end = 2022, extra=TRUE) #clean the dataset ch5_2&lt;-ch5_2 %&gt;% rename(gdp=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, iso_a3=iso2c) %&gt;% drop_na(gdp) #dropping missing values We are retrieving GDP data for all countries from 2000 to 2022 and we are also renaming columns to match with map data found in the rnaturalearth. We also remove missing GDP values ch5map&lt;-ne_countries(scale = &quot;medium&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;) This fetches the world map with country boundaries in sf (simple features) format to visualize the GDP data. We fetch medium-scale country boundaries in spatial data format and the returnclass=\"sf\" ensures it can be used with ggplot2 #Merge wgdp&lt;-ch5map %&gt;% left_join(ch5_2, by=&quot;iso_a3&quot;) We need to match the GDP data with the corresponding country for visualization. You can opt to retrieve the world map to find out how to merge both. ggplot(data = wgdp) + geom_sf(aes(fill = gdp_md)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(option = &quot;plasma&quot;, trans = &quot;log&quot;, na.value = &quot;grey&quot;) + theme_minimal() + labs(title = &quot;GDP by Country&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Data from WDI&quot;, fill = &quot;GDP (log scale)&quot;) We use the merged map and GDP data and geom_sf(aes(fill=gdp_md)) filles countries based on GDP. The scale_fill_viridis_c uses “plasma” which is best used for maps. The log scale transformation is used to better differentiate large economies and small economies and grey fill for missing data. 10.6.1.1 Animated World Map for GDP Now we create an animated version of the map. You need to check that your time variable does not have any NA. It would be better to choose the years that are available consecutively so we will filter the data to only include from 2009-2019. unique(wgdp$gdp_year) ## [1] 2019 2014 2018 2017 2016 2013 2010 2009 2012 2006 2015 2003 2007 2011 # Filter for years 2009-2019 wgdp_filtered &lt;- wgdp %&gt;% filter(gdp_year %in% 2009:2019) ch5.6 &lt;- ggplot(data = wgdp_filtered) + geom_sf(aes(fill = gdp_md)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(option = &quot;plasma&quot;, trans = &quot;log&quot;, na.value = &quot;grey50&quot;) + theme_minimal() + labs(title = &quot;World GDP by Country: {closest_state}&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Data from World Development Indicators&quot;, fill = &quot;GDP (log scale)&quot;) + transition_states(gdp_year) + ease_aes(&#39;linear&#39;) 10.6.1.2 Saving and Embedding Animation anim_file6&lt;-&quot;worldgdp.gif&quot; animate(ch5.6, duration = 10, fps = 15, renderer = gifski_renderer(anim_file6), preview = TRUE) knitr::include_graphics(anim_file6) 10.7 Philippine Regional Map We will use Ch6.xlsx containing Regional GDP and use the Philippine Regions shapefile. rm(list=ls()) gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 3727747 199.1 6611092 353.1 5482173 292.8 ## Vcells 7664450 58.5 14786712 112.9 14786663 112.9 library(sf) layers&lt;-st_layers(&quot;PH_Adm1_Regions.shp&quot;) print(layers) ## Driver: ESRI Shapefile ## Available layers: ## layer_name geometry_type features fields crs_name ## 1 PH_Adm1_Regions.shp Polygon 17 7 WGS 84 / UTM zone 51N ## 2 Regions.shp Polygon 17 19 WGS 84 sp_df = sf::st_read( dsn= &#39;PH_Adm1_Regions.shp&#39;, layer=&quot;Regions.shp&quot;) ## Reading layer `Regions.shp&#39; from data source ## `C:\\Users\\jemma\\OneDrive\\Documents\\DLSU\\LBOMETR_Book\\PH_Adm1_Regions.shp&#39; ## using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 17 features and 19 fields ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 114.2779 ymin: 4.587294 xmax: 126.605 ymax: 21.12189 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 The code loads the sf package then st_layers checks all available layers in the shapefile because some shapefiles contains multiple layers like administrative boundaries, water bodies, etc. so we display the available layers in the console.

It is commonly used in geographic data visualization to show spatial variations across different regions. For the static map, let us choose the latest year, 2023; rgdp2023&lt;-rgdp_map %&gt;% filter(Year==2023) library(scales) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;scales&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:purrr&#39;: ## ## discard ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:readr&#39;: ## ## col_factor # Modify the Choropleth Map ggplot(rgdp2023) + geom_sf(aes(fill = GDP), color = &quot;white&quot;) + # Fill regions based on GDP scale_fill_viridis_c( option = &quot;magma&quot;, name = &quot;GDP (2023)&quot;, labels = label_number(accuracy = 0.1, suffix = &quot;B&quot;, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;) # Fix rounding issue ) + labs(title = &quot;Regional GDP of the Philippines (2023)&quot;) + theme_minimal() #Saving the images #ggsave(&quot;rgdp2023.jpg&quot;, plot = last_plot(), width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 300) #or plot = nameofplot, width and height are in inches and for high quality image, dpi = 300 10.7.0.2 Bubble Map A Bubble Map is a type of thematic map that represents data values using circles (bubbles) placed over specific locations. The size of the bubble corresponds to the magnitude of the variable being visualized (e.g., GDP, population, sales, etc.). We use 2023 again. The first step that we need to do is calculate the centroids using st_centroid from the sf package because this calculates the geometric center of each polygon region in the shapefile. These will be used as our bubble locations and to ensure that there will be no overlapping with borders. phr_centroids&lt;-st_centroid(rgdp2023) ## Warning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries print(phr_centroids) ## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 3 fields ## Geometry type: POINT ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 119.8902 ymin: 11.35282 xmax: 119.8902 ymax: 11.35282 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 ## region Year GDP geometry ## 1 MIMAROPA Region 2023 0.411435 POINT (119.8902 11.35282) We now create our Bubble Map ggplot()+ geom_sf(data=rgdp2023, fill = &quot;gray&quot;, color=&quot;white&quot;)+#base map geom_point(data = phr_centroids, aes(x = st_coordinates(geometry)[,1], y = st_coordinates(geometry)[,2], size = GDP, color = GDP), alpha = 0.7) + scale_size(range = c(2, 15), name = &quot;GDP (2023)&quot;) + # Adjust bubble size scale_color_viridis_c(option = &quot;magma&quot;, name = &quot;GDP (2023)&quot;, labels = label_number(accuracy = 0.1, suffix = &quot;B&quot;, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;)) + labs(title = &quot;Regional GDP of the Philippines (2023)&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Bubble Size Represents GDP&quot;, x=&quot;Coordinates&quot;, y=&quot;Coordinates&quot;)+ theme_minimal() As you can see, the base map is drawn using geom_sf() then the bubbles represent the GDP values. The bubble size and color represent GDP magnitude. You will notice that ggplot() is empty, this creates an empty ggplot canvas where the map layers will be added using the geom_sf. In the aes there’s x = st_coordinates(geometry)[,1] same for y. These extract the longitude and latitude of each centroid. The scale_size() range sets the bubble sizes between 2 and 15 units but you can edit this. Now, scale_viridis_c has more things, the name sets the legend title for GDP colors. the labels ensures decimal precision and adds suffix B, plus, adds comma separators since we do not want the legend to contain scientific notations. 10.8 Animated Map 10.8.0.1 Animated Philippine Regional GDP Choropleth Map We will now make an animated version of the Regional GDP Choropleth Map since we have data from 2000 to 2023. Let’s convert to billions like what we did for the 2023. It takes really long to render (it depends on the memory you have in your laptops) so, I will place the best strategy, that is creating static maps and combining them to form a video. Notice that when cleaning the environment, I chose to keep rgdp_map since we will still use this. rm(list = setdiff(ls(), &quot;rgdp_map&quot;)) gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 3782760 202.1 6611092 353.1 6611092 353.1 ## Vcells 33797981 257.9 89456061 682.5 89456061 682.5 #for mp4 if (!require(av)) install.packages(&quot;av&quot;) ## Loading required package: av library(av) We need to create a directory within our working directory where the images will be saved. dir.create(&quot;ch_gdp_frames&quot;, showWarnings = FALSE) We now generate static maps; this requires us to create a function/loop. You will notice that the plot.background was set twice. It is because when we use the av, the default is a black setting so it’s better to have a white background set for the plot and the entire canvas. for(year in 2000:2023){ #filter data for the specific year data_year&lt;-rgdp_map %&gt;% filter(Year==year) #Generate the plot ip&lt;-ggplot(data_year) + geom_sf(aes(fill = GDP), color = &quot;white&quot;) + scale_fill_viridis_c( option = &quot;magma&quot;, name = &quot;GDP&quot;, labels = scales::label_number(accuracy = 0.1, suffix = &quot;B&quot;, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;) ) + labs( title = paste(&quot;Regional GDP of the Philippines&quot;), subtitle = paste(&quot;Year:&quot;, year), fill = &quot;GDP (Billion $)&quot; ) + theme_minimal() + theme( plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = &quot;bold&quot;), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14), panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, color = NA), # Set white background plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, color = NA) # Set white background ) # Save the plot as an image ggsave(filename = paste0(&quot;ch_gdp_frames/gdp_&quot;, year, &quot;.png&quot;), plot = ip, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300) } You need to edit some parts, such as the 2000:2023 with whatever years you have; you need to filter data depending on how you called the time column. Then edit the fill and other things. We now combine our static maps into MP4. If you want the transition for each year to be seen clearly, the framerate is set at 1 to have 1 frame per second and the frame is repeated twice. the vfilter makes the video HD file_list &lt;- list.files(&quot;ch_gdp_frames&quot;, pattern = &quot;gdp_.*\\\\.png&quot;, full.names = TRUE) rep_files &lt;- rep(file_list, each = 2) # Repeat each frame twice av::av_encode_video( input = rep_files, output = &quot;ch_rgdp_time.mp4&quot;, framerate = 1, vfilter = &quot;scale=1280:720&quot; ) 10.9 Practical: Advanced Visualizations For the practical, you need to search and clean the dataset on your own. Please search in PSA OpenStat: Number of Registered Live Births by Sex and by Usual Residence of Mother (Region, Province and Highly Urbanized City), Philippines: January - December 2013-2022. Only gather regional data since the shapefile that is given for this practical is for Regions only. Please save each animation using anim_save Using PSA OpenStat (2013-2022) data, create an animated bar chart showing the total number of live births per year. Differentiate Male vs. Female births using fill Create an animated bar chart that compares the number of live births per region over time (2013-2022). Use transition_states(year, wrap = FALSE) to animate regional birth counts changing over time. Determine the region with the highest live births in each frame. Select 3-5 regions and visualize their live birth trends (2013-2022) using an animated time series plot. Using PSA OpenStat (2013-2022) data and a Philippines regional shapefile, create a static choropleth map of the recent number of live births per region. Color the regions based on birth count Using PSA OpenStat (2013-2022) data and a Philippines regional shapefile, create an animated choropleth map showing how the number of live births per region changes over time. Color the regions based on birth count How do birth trends differ across Philippine regions? Which regions have experienced the highest increase or decrease in live births from 2013 to 2022? How does using gganimate with sf enhance your ability to analyze spatial(and time) data trends?

For both sex separately, report the mean and standard deviation. 11.2.1 Male Calculate the descriptive statistics for the variable Q37a_HoursWeekChildren, using the function describe of the package psych: psych::describe(Dataset_CP_m$Q37a_HoursWeekChildren) ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se ## X1 1 575 16.86 15.53 10 14.36 10.38 1 100 99 1.83 4.65 0.65 Notice how we directly use the describe function on the variable Q37a_HoursWeekChildren (called with the dollar sign operator, $, which works as follows: name_dataset$name_variable - notice that to access a specific variable, some functions can use the pipe operator while others require the dollar sign operator, as in this case). Notice also how we call the function describe: we use the :: operator, which tells R to look for a function within a specific package as follows name_package::name_function You could also simply call the function by only using its name, R will then search for that specific function across all the loaded R packages. However, if more packages have functions with the same name, specifying the name of the package with the :: operator helps assuring the usage of the correct function. Report the Frequency Table for the variable Q37a_HoursWeekChildren, using the function tbl_summary of the package gtsummary: Dataset_CP_m %&gt;% select(Q37a_HoursWeekChildren) %&gt;% tbl_summary( statistic = list(all_categorical() ~ &quot;{n} ({p}%)&quot;), # Show count &amp;

} Hours per Week with Children N = 1,7231 Q37a_HoursWeekChildren 10 (5, 24) 1 Median (Q1, Q3) The table shows that there are 1, 723 non-missing observations for the variable, Q37a_HoursWeekChildren The median value of hours per week with children is 10 hours. (5,24) represents the interquartile range. Q1 (5): The first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) are 5 and 24 hours respectively. This simply means that 50% of the responses lie between 5 and 24 hours per week. When interpreting: “The median hours per week spent with children of males is 10 hours, with half of the respondents reporting values between 5 and 24 hours. The total sample size is 1,723.” Moreover, in R there are other ways to access specific elements within a dataset. Datasets are organized in rows (which represent our observations) and columns (which represent our variables). We can select a specific cell of a dataset as follows: name_dataset[row, column], where row is the number(s) of row(s) we are interested in and column is either the number or the name of the column we are interested in. For instance, if we want to select the value of the variable Q37a_HoursWeekChildren for the third observation, we can use the following command Dataset_CP[3,“Q37a_HoursWeekChildren”] If we do not specify a value for the rows (or columns), we select all the rows (or columns) of the specified columns (or rows). For instance, the following command selects all the observations for the variable Q37a_HoursWeekChildren Dataset_CP[ ,“Q37a_HoursWeekChildren”] 11.3 Histogram Plot the histogram for the variable Q37a_HoursWeekChildren ggplot(data = Dataset_CP_m, aes(x = Q37a_HoursWeekChildren)) + geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = &quot;darkred&quot;, fill = &quot;pink&quot;) + theme_minimal()+ labs(title = &quot;Histogram: Hours per week spent taking care of children&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Only male respondents&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Hours per week spent taking care of children (Question 37a)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Count&quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(color = &quot;darkred&quot;, size = 14, face = &quot;italic&quot;), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = &quot;darkred&quot;, size = 12, face = &quot;italic&quot;)) Depending on the data, different number of bins are more or less appropriate. In this case, we indicate that we want our data to be split in 50 intervals. You could indicate a different number or you could also leave the bins option out of the code and let R select it (R will give a warning (not error) about the number of bins which has been selected). Each type of graph has its own set of options that can be set, use the help function to learn more about them. Next, we call a pre-defined layout of the graph called theme_minimal. There are many pre-defined layouts and you are free to choose whichever you like the most, or even create your own layout (which is partially what we do with the last layer). In the fourth layer we use labs in order to define the title of the graph, we add a subtitle and we specify the name of the axes. There are more options that you can define within labs, use help(labs) to find out what these are. Finally, we edit the appearance of the title and subtitle using theme and introducing the elements plot.title = element_text() and plot.subtitle = element_text(), where we specify their color, size and face. With that, we are able to change the format of the title and subtitle, however, it is not always necessary. If you want to find out more options that you can specify within theme, you can use help(“theme”) or search in Google. 11.4 Summary Table To summarize, we can build a table showing the mean and the standard deviation for the variable Q37a_HoursWeekChildren for the two groups, separately. To do so, we use two features: First, in the menu bar of your Quarto document (on top), we click on “Table” and then select “Insert Table”. A new window will appear and ask us the number of rows and columns our table should include. Once the table has been created, we can fill in its cells with whatever we wish to present in the table. Second, we use inline code, which allows us to embed directly into the text the output of an R code (you can find more information about inline coding here). A chunk of code, as we have seen so far, is separated from the text of our Quarto document and does not allow us to build a readable text combining words with output from R codes which in one linear sentence. So, if we want to say: The number of male respondents in our dataset is equal to Dataset_CP_m %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) ## # A tibble: 1 × 1 ## n ## &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1723 We can clearly see that this is not ideal when using a chunk of code. To better integrate this into our text we can use inline code. To do so, in the menu bar of our Quarto document (on top), we click on “&lt;/&gt;”, then we type r and add a space and then write the line of code we would like to execute in order to include its output into the text. In our previous example, this could be done by writing as an inline code “r Dataset_CP_m %&gt;% summarize(n = n())”, as follows: The number of male respondents in our dataset is equal to 1723 This could be useful, for instance, if we wish to present some properties of the data without us manually copy-pasting the numbers from the console to the text. At the same time, we can use this to populate our table, as we indeed do below. Note: In a Quarto document, you can run the code which is included in a chunk of code with the green play button. This allows you to execute and visualize the output of that specific command. Unfortunately, inline codes do not have the same option. Inline codes will be executed only when the Quarto document is rendered. This means that you cannot directly see the result of inline codes before you render your Quarto document nor you can verify if that code is correct (and if it is not, the rendering will not work). To overcome this issue, you can copy-paste the code of your inline code into the Console and run it from there. This will allow you to verify if the code is correct and what is the output. We have created here a table summarizing some of the descriptive statistics for the male respondents in our dataset. Take a look at this table: Male Code N_total 1723 Dataset_CP_m %&gt;% summarize (n=n()) N_missing 1148 Dataset_CP_m%&gt;% summarize(n_na=sum(is.na(Q37a_HoursWeekChildren))) N_valid 575 Dataset_CP_m%&gt;%summarize(n_valid=sum(!is.na(Q37a_HoursWeekChildren))) Mean 16.8591304 Dataset_CP_m%&gt;%summarize(mean = mean(Q37a_HoursWeekChildren, na.rm=T)) Median 10 Dataset_CP_m%&gt;%summarize(median = median(Q37a_HoursWeekChildren, na.rm=T)) Std. Deviation 15.5294252 Dataset_CP_m%&gt;% summarize(sd=sd(Q37a_HoursWeekChildren, na.rm=T)) Notice how we use the pipe operator on the dataset to compute the descriptive statistics with the summarize function and the n function to calculate the total number of observations; the is.na function to calculate the number of observations with missing values; the ! operator combined with the is.na function to calculate the opposite of the number of observations with missing values, i.e., the number of observations with valid values; the mean function to calculate the mean, with the na.rm option set to TRUE to tell R that there are missing values and it should compute the mean without considering the missing values; the median function to calculate the median, with the na.rm option set to TRUE to tell R that there are missing values and it should compute the median without considering the missing values. the sd function to calculate the standard deviation, with the na.rm option set to TRUE to tell R that there are missing values and it should compute the standard deviation without considering the missing values. 11.5 Interpretation of Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics serve as tools to summarize and organize data into meaningful insights, making it easier to understand and communicate findings. The following are the key aspects of descriptive statistics: 11.5.0.1 Definition Descriptive statistics involve summarizing, organizing, and simplifying data in a way that is understandable and interpretable. This can include numerical summaries, tables, and graphical representations to describe the distribution, central tendency, and variability of data. 11.5.1 Key Components of Descriptive Statistics Measures of Central Tendency: Mean: The average value, useful for symmetric distributions without outliers. Median: The middle value in the data, efficient even with skewness and outliers. Mode: The most frequent value, helpful for categorical or multimodal distributions. Measures of Variability: Range: Difference between the maximum and minimum values. Standard Deviation (SD): Indicates the average spread of data around the mean. Interquartile Range (IQR): Captures the spread of the middle 50% of the data. Data Distribution: Histograms and frequency distributions help identify the shape (e.g., symmetric, skewed, bimodal) and any potential outliers in the dataset. Data Representation: Graphical methods like bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and boxplots make patterns and trends in the data more visible and easier to interpret. 11.5.2 When to Use Mean or Median The mean is preferred when the data is symmetrically distributed without extreme values. The median is better for skewed distributions or datasets with significant outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values. Example: In income data, where a few individuals earn significantly more than the majority, the median provides a more realistic “typical” income. 11.5.3 Purpose of Descriptive Statistics To summarize large datasets into manageable insights. To provide a foundation for inferential statistics, which goes beyond describing the sample to drawing conclusions about the population. To describe relationships between variables, if applicable, through measures like correlation coefficients. 11.5.4 Limitations Descriptive statistics only describe the data at hand; they do not infer or predict trends in the population. Without considering measures of variability (e.g., SD or IQR), central tendency measures (mean, median) can be misleading. Descriptive statistics are limited in making generalizations beyond the sample data. 11.6 Practical: Descriptive Statistics You will still use the Dataset_CP data for the practical. 11.6.1 Descriptive Statistics Questions Q37b_HoursWeekHousework: What are the mean, median, and standard deviation for the time spent on housework (Q37b_HoursWeekHousework) for the entire dataset? Compare the mean and median for males and females. Is the mean or median a better representation of central tendency? Why? What does the standard deviation tell you about variability in housework hours? Q7_HoursWeekWork: What is the range of hours worked per week (Q7_HoursWeekWork) for males and females? Are there any noticeable outliers in the data? How could these affect the mean? Q37c_HoursWeekElderly: Plot a histogram for hours spent caring for the elderly (Q37c_HoursWeekElderly). Is the distribution symmetric, skewed, or bimodal? What might explain the shape of the distribution? In the dataset, males and females spend different amounts of time on housework (Q37b_HoursWeekHousework). What societal or cultural factors might explain this difference? How could this information be used to inform policy? How might understanding variability in working hours (Q7_HoursWeekWork) help employers or policymakers design better work-life balance policies? After calculating descriptive statistics and creating visualizations, what challenges did you face in interpreting the data? How did the choice of tools (e.g., psych, gtsummary) affect your approach? "],["hypothesis-testing.html", "12 Hypothesis Testing 12.1 Steps: 12.2 Difference between one-tailed test and two-tailed test 12.3 Test of Proportions 12.4 T-Tests", " 12 Hypothesis Testing 12.1 Steps: State null and alternative hypotheses Choose a test (one-tailed or two-tailed) Do the test Present your results Conclusion → reject the null or fail to reject Make a conclusion about your data (From our data, we have evidence that…) 12.2 Difference between one-tailed test and two-tailed test A two-tailed test checks whether a sample mean or proportion is significantly different from a given value in either direction (higher or lower). Null Hypothesis (H0​): There is no difference between the sample statistic and the population value. Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_\\alpha\\)): The sample statistic is either higher or lower than the population value. A one-tailed test checks if a sample statistic is significantly greater or smaller than a given value in one direction only. Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference OR the difference is in the opposite direction. Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_\\alpha\\)): The sample statistic is either higher or lower, but not both. 12.2.1 Deciding between One-Tailed versus Two-Tailed A central bank claims that the country’s average annual inflation rate is 3%. An economist wants to test whether this is incorrect. A government introduces a new minimum wage policy, and policymakers want to check whether it has decreased employment levels. A researcher wants to compare the GDP growth rate of two neighboring countries to see if they are different. An economist wants to determine whether male workers earn more than female workers in the same industry. A researcher wants to test whether developing countries receive less Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) than developed countries. 12.3 Test of Proportions A test of proportion is used when we want to check whether the proportion of a certain event (e.g., unemployment rate, poverty rate) in a sample is different from a known proportion in the population. 12.3.1 One-Sample Test of Proportion We use this test when we want to see if the proportion of a sample is different from the population proportion. Example: Unemployment Rate A government report claims that 8% of the labor force is unemployed. We collect a sample of 500 workers and find that 50 are unemployed. Is the actual unemployment rate significantly different from 8%? prop.test(x = 50, n = 500, p = 0.08, correct = FALSE) ## ## 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction ## ## data: 50 out of 500, null probability 0.08 ## X-squared = 2.7174, df = 1, p-value = 0.09926 ## alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.08 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.07667756 0.12942191 ## sample estimates: ## p ## 0.1 This employs prop.test then inside the parenthesis, we have x=Number of successes, n=total sample size and p=hypothesized population proportion. The correct=FALSE adjusts the t-statistic. The rule is to set it to TRUE for small sample sizes and FALSE for big sample sizes. If the p-value &lt; 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, meaning the unemployment rate in our sample is significantly different from 8%. If the p-value &gt; 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning we do not have enough evidence to say the unemployment rate differs from 8%. If we believe the true unemployment rate is higher than 8% prop.test(x = 50, n = 500, p = 0.08, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, correct = FALSE) ## ## 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction ## ## data: 50 out of 500, null probability 0.08 ## X-squared = 2.7174, df = 1, p-value = 0.04963 ## alternative hypothesis: true p is greater than 0.08 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.08003919 1.00000000 ## sample estimates: ## p ## 0.1 Since it is one-tailed, alternative = \"greater\" tests the direction. The alternative is changed if it is in the opposite direction. If we believe the true unemployment rate is lower than 8% prop.test(x = 50, n = 500, p = 0.08, alternative = &quot;less&quot;, correct = FALSE) ## ## 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction ## ## data: 50 out of 500, null probability 0.08 ## X-squared = 2.7174, df = 1, p-value = 0.9504 ## alternative hypothesis: true p is less than 0.08 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0000000 0.1242664 ## sample estimates: ## p ## 0.1 12.3.2 Two-Sample Test of Proportion We use this when comparing proportions between two groups (e.g., unemployment rates in two different regions). 12.3.2.1 Example: Employment Rate Comparison A researcher wants to compare the employment rates between urban and rural areas. In an urban area, 450 out of 500 people are employed. In a rural area, 420 out of 500 people are employed. We test whether the employment rates are significantly different. prop.test(x = c(450, 420), n = c(500, 500), correct = FALSE) ## ## 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction ## ## data: c(450, 420) out of c(500, 500) ## X-squared = 7.9576, df = 1, p-value = 0.004789 ## alternative hypothesis: two.sided ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.01847836 0.10152164 ## sample estimates: ## prop 1 prop 2 ## 0.90 0.84 The x= number of successes in the two groups, n=total number of sample sizes in the two groups. Interpreting the Results: If p-value &lt; 0.05: Employment rates differ significantly between urban and rural areas. If p-value &gt; 0.05: There is no significant difference in employment rates. If we believe urban employment rate is higher than rural: prop.test(x = c(450, 420), n = c(500, 500), alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, correct = FALSE) ## ## 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction ## ## data: c(450, 420) out of c(500, 500) ## X-squared = 7.9576, df = 1, p-value = 0.002394 ## alternative hypothesis: greater ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.02515394 1.00000000 ## sample estimates: ## prop 1 prop 2 ## 0.90 0.84 If we believe urban employment rate is lower than rural: prop.test(x = c(450, 420), n = c(500, 500), alternative = &quot;less&quot;, correct = FALSE) ## ## 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction ## ## data: c(450, 420) out of c(500, 500) ## X-squared = 7.9576, df = 1, p-value = 0.9976 ## alternative hypothesis: less ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.00000000 0.09484606 ## sample estimates: ## prop 1 prop 2 ## 0.90 0.84 12.3.3 Real-World Example: We are going to use the wage1 dataset from Wooldridge package but we do not want to do anything to the original dataset (though technically we can) but, better safe than sorry. library(wooldridge) data(wage1) sample&lt;-wage1 Is the proportion of female workers greater than 50%? prop.test(sum(sample$female), nrow(sample), p = 0.5, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, correct = FALSE) ## ## 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction ## ## data: sum(sample$female) out of nrow(sample), null probability 0.5 ## X-squared = 0.92015, df = 1, p-value = 0.8313 ## alternative hypothesis: true p is greater than 0.5 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.443458 1.000000 ## sample estimates: ## p ## 0.4790875 12.4 T-Tests A t-test is used to compare means (e.g., wages, GDP growth). Types of T-Tests: One-Sample T-Test: Compares a sample mean to a known value. Independent-Samples T-Test: Compares means of two different groups. Paired-Samples T-Test: Compares before and after effects within the same group. 12.4.1 One-Sample T-Test A report states that the average monthly wage in a country is 20,500. We take a sample of 100 workers and test if their wages differ. set.seed(123) wages&lt;-rnorm(100, mean=21000, sd=500) t.test(wages, mu=20500) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: wages ## t = 11.946, df = 99, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 20500 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 20954.64 21135.76 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 21045.2 The rnorm generates a random sample of 100 wages. Then the t.test performs a one-sample t-test by comparing if the sample mean (21000) is different from the hypothesized mean (20500) Interpreting the results: If p-value &lt; 0.05: The average wage is significantly different from 20,500. If p-value &gt; 0.05: There is no significant difference in wages. 12.4.2 Real-World Example Is the average hourly wage significantly different from $5 per hour? t.test(sample$wage, mu = 5) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: sample$wage ## t = 5.5649, df = 525, p-value = 4.186e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 5 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 5.579768 6.212437 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 5.896103 12.4.3 Independent-Samples T-Test We compare male and female wages in the same industry. set.seed(123) male_wage&lt;-rnorm(50, mean=23000, sd=600) female_wage&lt;-rnorm(50, mean=22500, sd=500) t.test(male_wage, female_wage, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: male_wage and female_wage ## t = 4.4149, df = 98, p-value = 2.603e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 246.3177 648.5583 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 23020.64 22573.20 This performs a two-sample t-test assuming equal variances. Interpreting the results: If p-value &lt; 0.05, wages differ significantly. If p-value &gt; 0.05, there is no significant difference. 12.4.3.1 Checking variance before running the T-Test Variance measures how spread out the data is around the mean. Low variance → Data points are close to the mean. High variance → Data points are spread out from the mean. var.test(male_wage, female_wage) ## ## F test to compare two variances ## ## data: male_wage and female_wage ## F = 1.5057, num df = 49, denom df = 49, p-value = 0.1556 ## alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.8544445 2.6533137 ## sample estimates: ## ratio of variances ## 1.505692 If variance ratio is close to 1, assume equal variances (var.equal = TRUE). 12.4.4 Real-World Example Do men and women earn different wages? #check variance var.test(sample$wage[sample$female == 1], sample$wage[wage1$female == 0]) ## ## F test to compare two variances ## ## data: sample$wage[sample$female == 1] and sample$wage[wage1$female == 0] ## F = 0.36954, num df = 251, denom df = 273, p-value = 4.813e-15 ## alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2900223 0.4714405 ## sample estimates: ## ratio of variances ## 0.3695359 Interpreting the variance ratio: Null Hypothesis (H0): The variances of male and female wages are equal Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_\\alpha\\)): The variances of male and female wages are not equal t.test(sample$wage ~ sample$female, var.equal = FALSE) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: sample$wage by sample$female ## t = 8.44, df = 456.33, p-value = 4.243e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 1.926971 3.096690 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group 0 mean in group 1 ## 7.099489 4.587659 ~ Means “wage depends on gender” (separates the dependent and independent variable) 12.4.5 Paired-Samples T-Test A new minimum wage policy was introduced. We analyze its impact on worker wages before and after implementation. set.seed(0) wage_before &lt;- rnorm(50, mean = 32000, sd = 400) wage_after &lt;- wage_before + rnorm(50, mean = 2500, sd = 100) t.test(wage_before, wage_after, paired = TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: wage_before and wage_after ## t = -206.45, df = 49, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2526.496 -2477.785 ## sample estimates: ## mean difference ## -2502.141 This means that wage_after was simply the wages after the policy were increased by approx. 2500 per worker. The t.test simply performs a paired t-test that is why paired=TRUE Interpreting the Results: If p-value &lt; 0.05: The minimum wage policy significantly increased wages. If p-value &gt; 0.05: The policy had no significant effect. Did wages increase? t.test(wage_before, wage_after, paired = TRUE, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: wage_before and wage_after ## t = -206.45, df = 49, p-value = 1 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean difference is greater than 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2522.46 Inf ## sample estimates: ## mean difference ## -2502.141 "],["ordinary-least-squares.html", "13 Ordinary Least Squares 13.1 General Description and notation of a Linear Regression 13.2 Running and reporting OLS Regression 13.3 Interpretation of Coefficients 13.4 Goodness of Fit (F-Statistics and Adjusted R-squared) 13.5 Assumption Diagnostics 13.6 Real-World Example 13.7 Practical: Hypothesis Testing and OLS 13.8 Hypothesis Testing 13.9 OLS", " 13 Ordinary Least Squares 13.1 General Description and notation of a Linear Regression In R, the set.seed() function is used to set the random number generator’s seed. Random number generators in computer programming are not truly random; they are pseudo-random, meaning they generate sequences of numbers that appear random but are actually determined by an initial starting point called a seed. If you set the seed to a specific value, you can reproduce the same sequence of random numbers every time you run your program. This is important in many data analysis and simulation tasks, as it allows for the results to be reproducible. Note: we will use the cat() function today. The cat() function is used for printing or concatenating objects to the console. It is primarily used to display text, numbers, or other R objects on the screen or to write them to a file. The name “cat” stands for “concatenate” or “concatenation,” as the function can be used to combine and display multiple objects. library(tidyverse) rm(list = setdiff(ls(), &quot;sample&quot;)) gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 4001085 213.7 6611092 353.1 6611092 353.1 ## Vcells 8221516 62.8 57251880 436.8 89456061 682.5 # Generate example data set.seed(123) n &lt;- 50 x &lt;- runif(n, 0, 10) y &lt;- 2 * x + rnorm(n, 0, 2) # Create a scatterplot ggplot(data = data.frame(x, y), aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, color = &quot;blue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Scatterplot of Simulated Data&quot;, x = &quot;X&quot;, y = &quot;Y&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; 13.1.1 The notation cat(&quot;Linear Regression Notation:\\n&quot;) ## Linear Regression Notation: cat(&quot;Y = β₀ + β₁*X + ε\\n&quot;) ## Y = β₀ + β₁*X + ε cat(&quot;Y: Dependent variable (response)\\n&quot;) ## Y: Dependent variable (response) cat(&quot;X: Independent variable (predictor)\\n&quot;) ## X: Independent variable (predictor) cat(&quot;β₀: Intercept (constant)\\n&quot;) ## β₀: Intercept (constant) cat(&quot;β₁: Coefficient for X (slope)\\n&quot;) ## β₁: Coefficient for X (slope) cat(&quot;ε: Error (residuals)\\n&quot;) ## ε: Error (residuals) 13.2 Running and reporting OLS Regression In R, the lm() function is used to fit linear regression models. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by finding the best-fitting linear equation. The lm() function is a fundamental tool for performing linear regression analysis in R. Here’s how to use the lm() function in R: model &lt;- lm(dependent_variable ~ independent_variable1 + independent_variable2, data = your_data_frame) Let’s break down the components of this function: dependent_variable: This is the variable you want to predict or model. It is the response variable, typically numeric. independent_variable1, independent_variable2, …: These are the variables that you believe are related to the dependent variable. They are the predictor variables, which can be numeric or categorical. data: This argument specifies the data frame in which the variables are located. You should specify the name of your data frame here. The lm() function returns a linear regression model object, which contains information about the estimated coefficients and other statistical details of the model. After fitting the model, you can access various information and summaries, such as: summary(model): This function provides a detailed summary of the regression model, including coefficients, standard errors, t-values, p-values, R-squared, and more. coef(model): This function returns the estimated coefficients of the model. predict(model, newdata): You can use this function to make predictions with the model, where newdata is a data frame containing the values of the independent variables for which you want to make predictions. # Fit an OLS regression model model &lt;- lm(y ~ x) # Display the model summary summary(model) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -4.5116 -1.1157 -0.1313 1.0985 4.3723 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

For categorical independent variables (e.g., dummies for categories), the coefficients represent the difference in the dependent variable for that category compared to the reference category. # Extract and interpret coefficients cat(&quot;Intercept (β₀): &quot;, coef(model)[1], &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Intercept (β₀): -0.2847054 cat(&quot;Coefficient for X (β₁): &quot;, coef(model)[2], &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Coefficient for X (β₁): 2.076349 13.4 Goodness of Fit (F-Statistics and Adjusted R-squared) The null hypothesis (H0) for the F-test is that all coefficients in the model are equal to zero, meaning that none of the independent variables (wt and cyl) have any effect on the dependent variable. The small p-value (&lt;0.05) means we can reject the null hypothesis. Note: to extract p-value of F-statistic you have to use the function pf() that gives the area, for the F distribution, to the left of the value x for two given degrees of freedom, df1 and df2. # Adjusted R-squared cat(&quot;Adjusted R-squared: &quot;, summary(model)$adj.r.squared, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Adjusted R-squared: 0.9133112 # Print the F-statistic and p-value cat(&quot;F-statistic:&quot;, summary(model)$fstatistic[1], &quot;\\n&quot;) ## F-statistic: 517.2401 p_val = pf(summary(model)$fstatistic[1],summary(model)$fstatistic[2],summary(model)$fstatistic[3],lower.tail=FALSE) cat(&quot;p-value:&quot;, p_val, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## p-value: 2.364413e-27 13.5 Assumption Diagnostics In R, when you create a plot of a linear regression model (an OLS model) using the plot() function, it produces a set of diagnostic plots to help you assess the assumptions and goodness of fit of the model. These diagnostic plots are typically used to check if the model is a good fit for the data and whether the assumptions underlying linear regression are met. Here’s an explanation of each output produced by plot(model): Residuals vs. Fitted Values (Partial Regression Plot): This plot shows the relationship between the residuals (the differences between the observed values and the predicted values) and the fitted values (the predicted values from the model). It is used to check for linearity, which is one of the key assumptions of linear regression. Ideally, you want to see a random scattering of points around a horizontal line, with no clear pattern. If you see a pattern, such as a curve or funnel shape, it may indicate a violation of the linearity assumption. Normal Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) Plot: This plot compares the distribution of the residuals to a theoretical normal distribution. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points should roughly follow a straight line. Deviations from a straight line may indicate departures from normality in the residuals. For example, if the points bend upwards or downwards, it may indicate skewness or heavy-tailed residuals. Scale-Location (Spread-Location) Plot: This plot shows the square root of the absolute residuals against the fitted values. It is also known as a “spread vs. location” plot. It is used to check for homoscedasticity, which means that the variability of the residuals is roughly constant across different levels of the fitted values. Ideally, you want to see a random scattering of points around a horizontal line with roughly equal spread. If the spread changes systematically with the fitted values (e.g., a funnel shape), it may indicate heteroscedasticity, which can lead to unreliable parameter estimates and hypothesis tests. Residuals vs. Leverage Plot (Cook’s Distance Plot): This plot displays the standardized residuals against the leverage values (a measure of how much an observation affects the regression coefficients). It is often used to identify influential data points. Data points that are far from the other points in this plot have high leverage, and points above a certain threshold may be influential. Influential points can have a significant impact on the model’s parameters, and it’s important to examine them for potential outliers or errors. Cook’s Distance Plot: Cook’s distance is a measure of the impact of each observation on the model’s coefficients. This plot shows the Cook’s distance for each observation. Observations with a high Cook’s distance are potential outliers or influential points that can significantly affect the model. It is a useful tool for identifying data points that should be investigated further. Multicollinearity Correlation Matrix: A simple way to start is by looking at the correlation matrix of the predictors. High correlation coefficients (close to -1 or 1) between pairs of predictors indicate potential multicollinearity. This can be done using the cor() function. # Check OLS assumptions par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) plot(model) 13.6 Real-World Example We are going to use the sample dataset sample_sub&lt;-sample %&gt;% select(c(wage,educ,exper,tenure)) head(sample_sub) ## wage educ exper tenure ## 1 3.10 11 2 0 ## 2 3.24 12 22 2 ## 3 3.00 11 2 0 ## 4 6.00 8 44 28 ## 5 5.30 12 7 2 ## 6 8.75 16 9 8 Create a scatterplot # Create a scatterplot ggplot(data = sample_sub, aes(x = sample_sub$educ, y =sample_sub$wage)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, color = &quot;blue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Scatterplot of Wage Data&quot;, x = &quot;Education&quot;, y = &quot;Wage&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; # Fit an OLS regression model model.1 &lt;- lm(wage ~ educ, data=sample_sub) # Display the model summary summary(model.1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = wage ~ educ, data = sample_sub) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -5.3396 -2.1501 -0.9674 1.1921 16.6085 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Intercept, \\(\\beta_0\\) , measures the intercept of the default group (males) and \\(\\beta_0 + \\delta_0\\) is the intercept for females \\(\\beta_0 = 5.90\\) is the average value of wage. \\(\\delta_0 = -2.51\\) is the effect of the indicator variable female on wage Females have 2.51 lower wages than males.

For example, male and female cannot be both included in the regression because of perfect collinearity Including male instead of female in the regression: wage = \\(\\beta_0 + \\delta_0(1 - male) + \\epsilon\\) = wage = (\\(\\beta_0 + \\delta_0\\)) - \\(\\delta_0\\)male + \\(\\epsilon\\) The coefficient \\(-\\delta_0\\) on male has the same magnitude and significance, but opposite sign from the coefficient on female. The intercept in the model with male is \\((\\beta_0+\\delta_0)\\) , which can also be obtained from the model with female (average wage of females) A regression can be estimated with both male and female but with no constant (this approach is not commonly used) Interactions with another dummy variable Interaction term - multiply variable by dummy variable Interaction terms for variables female and married can be done in two different ways. include female and married and female*married in the regression wage = \\(\\beta_0 +\\beta_1female+\\beta_2married+\\beta_3female*married+\\epsilon\\) Create four categories: female*single, male*single, female*married, and male*married; include 3 of them in the regression model (male*single is the reference category).

A Study of Quotas for the Scheduled Castes in India” by Francesca Jensenius published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics. This study looks into the effects of an electoral quota implemented in 1974 for scheduled castes (SC), a historically marginalised group in India. Because of the scheduled castes’ weak position in society, they have difficulty in securing many political seats. For this problem set, we refer to  “reserved constituencies”  as the constituencies where only members of the scheduled caste can run for elections while the whole electorate votes regardless of their caste. We refer to “general constituencies” as the constituencies that did not have a quota. We use the quotas.csv and quotas codebook in Visualizations Module. Preliminaries: To be uniform, create a variable where a constituency that is a reserved one is labelled “1” and a general constituency is labelled “0” Conduct a descriptive statistics using psych package on the data; create a histogram of the newly created variable. Conduct an OLS regression with the following model. The regression outcome is the percentage of SCs in rural areas in AC living in a village with an educational institution (P_educVD01_sc). The main variable of interest is the type of constituency. The control factors are tot_pop71_true, SC_percent71_true, Plit71, Plit71_SC, P_W71, P_al71_SC, P_al71_nonSC. Create a regression line with only the main variable of interest. Interpret only the main variable of interest and the R-squared. Tell me why you think the control factors were added in the context of Econometrics and in terms of economics. With the regression results, conduct a variance inflation factor test. Interpret your results and what the test measures. With the regression results, conduct a Breusch-Pagan test or White’s test. Interpret your results and what the test measures. With the regression results, conduct a Ramsey Reset test. Interpret your results and what the test measures.
