Students will also gather and analyze their own real-world data to investigate a specific economic problem, applying econometric methods and presenting their findings in a final project. 2.3 Final Course Outputs CLOs Output Due Date CLO 1,2,4 Data Storytelling (OR) Week 10 CLO 1-4 Data Story Archive (PF/PR) 18:00 Tuesday Week 14 CLO 1-3 Problem Sets (QA) 18:00 Weeks 6 and 12 CLO 1,3 Short Quizzes (QA) Weeks 2-6, 8, 11-12 CLO 4 Class Participation (TW/OB) Weeks 1-12 2.4 Generative AI-Use Policy For each component of the final grade defined above, students must identify the generative AI usage policy level. The levels are: Free to Use – AI may be used without restriction. Allowed in Specific Contexts – AI may be used only for clearly defined purposes and must be cited. Banned – AI use is strictly prohibited. Grade Component Usage Policy Level Notes Data Storytelling (OR) Allowed in Specific Contexts Students may use generative AI only to brainstorm ideas, create outlines, and design slides. AI must not be used to generate or check final code or analysis. Data Story Archive (PF/PR) Banned AI use is strictly prohibited for writing, coding, or analyzing the archive. Work must reflect independent technical skill. Problem Sets (QA) Banned Students must independently write and debug code; AI may not generate or check solutions. Short Quizzes (QA) Banned AI use is not allowed during quizzes. Class Participation (TW/OB) Banned All participation must be based on students’ own understanding and contributions. This course is an applied coding and econometrics laboratory, designed to develop students’ ability to analyze real-world data, write reproducible code, and interpret econometric results independently. To support student learning and promote the responsible use of emerging technologies, students may use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) only for conceptual or exploratory coding assistance, such as: ● Understanding function syntax or usage ● Exploring coding strategies ● Learning general debugging approaches The use of generative AI is strictly prohibited for the following: ● Generating or checking final code for the Data Story Archive (report and code) ● Generating or checking code for Problem Sets ● Short quizzes ● Any submission intended to reflect independent technical skill Overreliance on AI may hinder students’ understanding of key concepts, which are essential to success in this course. Any unauthorized use of AI will be treated as academic dishonesty, in accordance with the university’s academic integrity policy. Students are encouraged to consult the instructor if they are unsure about the appropriate use of AI for specific tasks. 2.5 Classroom Policies 1. Assessments All major assessments are described below. Deadlines, formats, and submission requirements are non-negotiable. Assessment Format &amp; Submission Notes Short Quizzes In-class, 2 coding questions per session. Students work with a buddy to check each other’s answers. Each student underlines economic theory and econometric reasoning in their buddy’s paper and places check marks for each. No quizzes on Weeks 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14. Problem Set 1 Group submission (hard copy). Handwritten discussion + typed step-by-step R code + printed/pasted graphs. Covers material up to descriptive statistics. Due Week 7. Questions are provided on Day 1 in the LBOMETR Course Book. Problem Set 2 Group submission (hard copy). Handwritten discussion + typed step-by-step R code + printed/pasted graphs. Covers material from descriptive statistics to formal tests of assumptions. Due Week 12. Questions are provided on Day 1 in the LBOMETR Course Book. Data Storytelling (Oral Presentation) Group presentation in HyFlex classroom. Must include R visualizations and clear explanation of methodology, results, and conclusions. Graded individually, based on contribution, clarity, and engagement. Data Story Archive Group submission (hard copy) compiling R scripts, analyses, visualizations, and interpretations. Demonstrates independent mastery; must be concise, reproducible, and complete. AI or outside generation is not allowed. Hard copy must be submitted by Week 14. 2. Groupings Students will be divided into 5 groups of 6 on the first day of class. Groups are assigned based on in-class skill surveys: comfort with R and economic theory. Groups remain fixed throughout the semester. Roles (e.g., introduction, data cleaning, analysis, visualization, discussion) may rotate within the group for fairness, except for the assigned monitor if used. 3. Appointments &amp; Consultations Data Story Topic Consultation: Groups must meet with the professor before Week 5. Topic, methodology, or scope changes after Week 6 without notice will incur a 50% deduction on the Data Story grade. Mock Presentation &amp; Archive Consultation: Groups are encouraged to schedule 15-minute in-person sessions after Mock Presentation submission to improve the Data Story Archive. Slots are booked via a provided link. Other Consultations: Can be done via email. Lecturer responds only between 8 AM – 6 PM. 4. Grading Notes Perfect scores (100%) are very rare. Excellent students typically achieve up to ~95%. Grades reflect demonstrated mastery, quality of outputs, and adherence to rubrics. Attendance, participation, buddy system compliance, and group contributions are part of the class participation grade. No general incentives or extra credit are provided. 5. Class Monitor Responsibilities One student monitor per session, rotating weekly or biweekly, will oversee the buddy system. Responsibilities: Collect all buddy-checked papers after class. Record for each student: Buddy’s name who checked the paper. Number of checks received (0, 1, or 2). Ensure all buddy system procedures are followed (underlines and check marks). Submit a tally sheet to the professor by 6 PM of class day. Important: The monitor does not grade anything. Failure to follow these steps may affect participation points for the monitor or the class. 6. Attendance Attendance is monitored during in-person sessions. Attendance points contribute to class participation. Unexcused absence will not be able to have full marks in class participation and might miss short quizzes. Excused absence: no deduction (documentation required). 7. Buddy System Students must complete buddy checks for short quizzes as described in Section 1. Compliance is verified by the class monitor and reflected in participation scores. 8. Problem Sets Students are expected to complete and submit the assigned problem sets on time, including discussion, code, and visualizations as described above. 9. Data Storytelling &amp; Data Story Archive Follow all guidelines for oral presentations and written archive submissions, including hard copy submission and proper documentation of R code. Consultations are highly recommended to refine presentations and archive outputs. 10. Use of Course Materials All learning and teaching materials provided in this class are for the exclusive use of students enrolled in this course, Term 2, AY2025-26. Students are not allowed to upload, share, or distribute these materials publicly or to anyone other than their groupmates/classmates without the instructor’s permission. 2.5.1 EXCUSED ABSENCES POLICY: Students must process requests for excused absences from their respective Associate Deans. For SOE students, the Associate Dean of the School of Economics will only process requests for excused absences due to medical and mental health reasons. Covid-related leave requests are no longer accepted as of August 30, 2023. Students must provide official documentation from the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) for absences related to official university functions.  Procedure: Timing: Submit requests immediately upon returning to campus and no later than seven working days from the return date.  Request Letter: Write a letter to the Associate Dean including: ○ Course details (course name, section, faculty names, and emails) ○ Dates of absence(s) ○ Reason for absence with relevant details Supporting Documents: Attach validated documents from the appropriate university offices. Submission: Combine the letter and supporting documents into a single PDF and upload viathis form. Approved absences will be communicated to you and your professors within three working days. Note that processing is done only during regular weekday office hours.  Important: Only complete requests will be processed. Falsifying records is a major offense as per the Student Handbook (Section 9, pp. 85-87). Note: The syllabus is unique to the course per Term, per AY. Final syllabus uploaded in Animospace.

How about this question: “What is the relationship between hours spent per day on X/Twitter and reported levels of anxiety among undergraduate students in DLSU during 2020-2021?“ Which of the two achieves the SMART elements? 4.1.2 Relevance What will be asked by the audience? You need to ask yourselves the following questions; if you are able to, you are close to achieving a good presentation! What is the problem to be solved? Who cares about this problem and why? 4.1.3 For the data story, should I use Kaggle? The answer is NO because of the following reasons: It has already been cleaned and curated based on the owner’s own purposes. It may not accurately reflect the real-world data. It has limited context, potentially limiting your ability to interpret findings accurately. While some Kaggle datasets have clear sources, others may have unclear origins or have undergone modifications by multiple users raising concerns about data integrity. Thus, you should use credible sources like statistics from World Bank, government sites, etc. I am not saying that you can already drop Kaggle datasets. You can still use them for the following: Benchmarking: Compare your model on a well-known Kaggle dataset For learning: You can try to match how the datasets in Kaggle have been cleaned. You can also use the datasets to practice your codes before applying them to the data you found from other credible sources. Important to note: Check data documentation from Kaggle; this will help you find the sources and will help supplement your data story with reputable sources. Furthermore, this is LBOMETR class wherein you were taught how to clean a dataset. You have to gather and clean the data yourselves to align with your research question. 4.2 Comments on Research Questions: Please check your emails for comments regarding your research questions. The approved and final research questions will be posted in Animospace as an announcement. "],["basic-introduction-to-r.html", "5 Basic Introduction to R 5.1 Session Information 5.2 Preliminaries 5.3 Quarto Markdown 5.4 Packages 5.5 Instructions for Managing Working Directories 5.6 Note:", " 5 Basic Introduction to R This portion of the book offers an introduction to the basics of R. R offers a wide variety of functionality. Note that this book only offers basic Econometric analysis. It will be useful to have some basic familiarity with R and its syntax but this is not strictly necessary. Each chapter includes both R code and results to make it easier for students to follow along, even without detailed knowledge of R. 5.1 Session Information This version of the book was built using R version 4.4.2. See below for the session information: ## R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31 ucrt) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 ## Running under: Windows 11 x64 (build 26200) ## ## Matrix products: default ## LAPACK version 3.12.1 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Netherlands.utf8 LC_CTYPE=English_Netherlands.utf8 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Netherlands.utf8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Netherlands.utf8 ## ## time zone: Asia/Manila ## tzcode source: internal ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] digest_0.6.39 R6_2.6.1 bookdown_0.46 fastmap_1.2.0 xfun_0.55 ## [6] cachem_1.1.0 knitr_1.51 htmltools_0.5.9 rmarkdown_2.30 lifecycle_1.0.4 ## [11] cli_3.6.5 sass_0.4.10 jquerylib_0.1.4 compiler_4.5.2 rstudioapi_0.17.1 ## [16] tools_4.5.2 evaluate_1.0.5 bslib_0.9.0 yaml_2.3.12 jsonlite_2.0.0 ## [21] rlang_1.1.6 5.2 Preliminaries The first step is to gain access to R, which is free and available on the R website: http://cran.r-project.org/. Simply go to the R website, select the appropriate location and operating system, and follow the instructions to download the base distribution of R. RStudio offers a user friendly environment to run R and is recommended. RStudio Screen Once R is opened, we can begin to run commands. R commands can be run directly from the console, from the R script editor or from a text editor separate from R. R offers detailed help files for each function. To access help, run: ?sum All lines proceeded by a # are comments and will not run. For example: # This is a comment. R will not recognize this as a command. 5.3 Quarto Markdown In LBOMETR, Quarto Markdown will be used by the students when submitting the Scripts for the Data Story Archive. Quarto Markdown is a tool for creating documents, reports and presentations using Markdown and executable code. Below is a concise guide to help you get started, along with key shortcuts for both Mac and Windows. 5.3.1 1. Starting a Quarto File To begin creating a Quarto document, follow these steps: Open RStudio. Go to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document. Choose the document type (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) and specify whether the document will include code. For ease, we will use the html document type. I have also added a sample Quarto Markdown file you can copy. Quarto Markdown Template 2. Quarto Key Features Code Chunks Code chunks allow you to include and run code inside your document. Inline Code Embed R code in text using backticks and r .

The packages will not be immediately available when R is opened. A package only has to be installed once on a computer, but the package will have to be loaded every time R is restarted. We can install a package individually as we need them. For example, to install tidyverse and psych, we would do: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;psych&quot;) In the tidyverse package, the ggplot2 is usually included; if you do not see the package in the Packages list at the lower right, you can do this: if(!(&quot;ggplot2&quot; %in% installed.packages()[,&quot;Package&quot;])) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Now that we have our packages successfully installed, we can go ahead and load them into R. Here we will load the tidyverse package as an example. We can use of all the functions available in that package once it is loaded into R. We load packages by using a library() function. The input is the name of the package, not in quotes. library(tidyverse) We can look up all of the functions within a package by using a help() function. For example, let’s look at the functions available in the tidyverse package. help(package = tidyverse) Note that the package argument is necessary to look up all of the functions. We can also detach a package if we no longer want it loaded. This is sometimes useful if two packages do not play well together. Here we will use a detach() function. detach(package:tidyverse) For simplicity, we will assume that the reader has restarted R at the beginning of each tutorial. 5.5 Instructions for Managing Working Directories This guide outlines how team members should set up their local working directories for collaboration, handle .qmd files, and organize them in a shared Google Drive. 5.5.1 1. Local Working Directory Setup Each team member should create a local folder on their own laptops to work on qmd files. This folder is where you will store and edit your files before uploading them to the shared Google Drive. 5.5.1.1 Steps: Create a folder on your laptop named: DLSU_LBOMETR_Section Use this folder to save and organize your .qmd files while working locally. 5.5.2 2. File Naming Convention To avoid confusion, ensure all .qmd files are named as follows: Include your name or initials and a brief description of the content Example: jem_nario_descriptivestatistics.qmd jmn_piechart.qmd 5.5.3 3. Shared Google Drive Setup A shared Google Drive will serve as the central repository for all project files, including: .qmd files from all team members Data files Rendered HTML and PDF files for final submission Supporting documents or references. 5.5.4 4. Workflow for .qmd files For each team member: Work locally Create your .qmd file in your local DLSU_LBOMETR_Section folder Ensure it is well-documented and organized. Upload to Google Drive For the Team Leader: Collect and Combine Files Gather all .qmd files from the team folder on the shared drive. Combine them Render the final report 5.5.5 5. Rendering the Final Report The final report should be rendered in HTML and printed by the team leader. 5.5.6 Summary Workflow Each Team Member: Work on your .qmd file locally. Upload your file to the shared Google Drive under team-members-qmd. Team Leader: Collect .qmd files from the shared drive. Combine them into a single final_report.qmd. Render the final report into HTML and PDF. Upload the rendered files to the final-report folder on the shared Google Drive. This ensures an organized and efficient workflow while centralizing all files in the shared Google Drive for easy access and submission. 5.6 Note: For the next chapters, before coming to class, ensure that you have installed the necessary packages. Therefore, please go to the next chapters of the course book then Find codes that have install.packages. Please install all the packages so that you will not have any issues.
