Students will also gather and analyze their own real-world data to investigate a specific economic problem, applying econometric methods and presenting their findings in a final project. 2.3 Final Course Outputs CLOs Output Due Date CLO 1,2,4 Data Storytelling (OR) Week 10 CLO 1-4 Data Story Archive (PF/PR) 18:00 Tuesday Week 14 CLO 1-3 Problem Sets (QA) 18:00 Weeks 6 and 12 CLO 1,3 Short Quizzes (QA) Weeks 2-6, 8, 11-12 CLO 4 Class Participation (TW/OB) Weeks 1-12 2.4 Generative AI-Use Policy For each component of the final grade defined above, students must identify the generative AI usage policy level. The levels are: Free to Use – AI may be used without restriction. Allowed in Specific Contexts – AI may be used only for clearly defined purposes and must be cited. Banned – AI use is strictly prohibited. Grade Component Usage Policy Level Notes Data Storytelling (OR) Allowed in Specific Contexts Students may use generative AI only to brainstorm ideas, create outlines, and design slides. AI must not be used to generate or check final code or analysis. Data Story Archive (PF/PR) Banned AI use is strictly prohibited for writing, coding, or analyzing the archive. Work must reflect independent technical skill. Problem Sets (QA) Banned Students must independently write and debug code; AI may not generate or check solutions. Short Quizzes (QA) Banned AI use is not allowed during quizzes. Class Participation (TW/OB) Banned All participation must be based on students’ own understanding and contributions. This course is an applied coding and econometrics laboratory, designed to develop students’ ability to analyze real-world data, write reproducible code, and interpret econometric results independently. To support student learning and promote the responsible use of emerging technologies, students may use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) only for conceptual or exploratory coding assistance, such as: ● Understanding function syntax or usage ● Exploring coding strategies ● Learning general debugging approaches The use of generative AI is strictly prohibited for the following: ● Generating or checking final code for the Data Story Archive (report and code) ● Generating or checking code for Problem Sets ● Short quizzes ● Any submission intended to reflect independent technical skill Overreliance on AI may hinder students’ understanding of key concepts, which are essential to success in this course. Any unauthorized use of AI will be treated as academic dishonesty, in accordance with the university’s academic integrity policy. Students are encouraged to consult the instructor if they are unsure about the appropriate use of AI for specific tasks. 2.5 Classroom Policies 1. Assessments All major assessments are described below. Deadlines, formats, and submission requirements are non-negotiable. Assessment Format &amp; Submission Notes Short Quizzes In-class, 2 coding questions per session. Students work with a buddy to check each other’s answers. Each student underlines economic theory and econometric reasoning in their buddy’s paper and places check marks for each. No quizzes on Weeks 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14. Problem Set 1 Group submission (hard copy). Handwritten discussion + typed step-by-step R code + printed/pasted graphs. Covers material up to descriptive statistics. Due Week 7. Questions are provided on Day 1 in the LBOMETR Course Book. Problem Set 2 Group submission (hard copy). Handwritten discussion + typed step-by-step R code + printed/pasted graphs. Covers material from descriptive statistics to formal tests of assumptions. Due Week 12. Questions are provided on Day 1 in the LBOMETR Course Book. Data Storytelling (Oral Presentation) Group presentation in HyFlex classroom. Must include R visualizations and clear explanation of methodology, results, and conclusions. Graded individually, based on contribution, clarity, and engagement. Data Story Archive Group submission (hard copy) compiling R scripts, analyses, visualizations, and interpretations. Demonstrates independent mastery; must be concise, reproducible, and complete. AI or outside generation is not allowed. Hard copy must be submitted by Week 14. 2. Groupings Students will be divided into 5 groups of 6 on the first day of class. Groups are assigned based on in-class skill surveys: comfort with R and economic theory. Groups remain fixed throughout the semester. Roles (e.g., introduction, data cleaning, analysis, visualization, discussion) may rotate within the group for fairness, except for the assigned monitor if used. 3. Appointments &amp; Consultations Data Story Topic Consultation: Groups must meet with the professor before Week 5. Topic, methodology, or scope changes after Week 6 without notice will incur a 50% deduction on the Data Story grade. Mock Presentation &amp; Archive Consultation: Groups are encouraged to schedule 15-minute in-person sessions after Mock Presentation submission to improve the Data Story Archive. Slots are booked via a provided link. Other Consultations: Can be done via email. Lecturer responds only between 8 AM – 6 PM. 4. Grading Notes Perfect scores (100%) are very rare. Excellent students typically achieve up to ~95%. Grades reflect demonstrated mastery, quality of outputs, and adherence to rubrics. Attendance, participation, buddy system compliance, and group contributions are part of the class participation grade. No general incentives or extra credit are provided. 5. Class Monitor Responsibilities One student monitor per session, rotating weekly or biweekly, will oversee the buddy system. Responsibilities: Collect all buddy-checked papers after class. Record for each student: Buddy’s name who checked the paper. Number of checks received (0, 1, or 2). Ensure all buddy system procedures are followed (underlines and check marks). Submit a tally sheet to the professor by 6 PM of class day. Important: The monitor does not grade anything. Failure to follow these steps may affect participation points for the monitor or the class. 6. Attendance Attendance is monitored during in-person sessions. Attendance points contribute to class participation. Unexcused absence will not be able to have full marks in class participation and might miss short quizzes. Excused absence: no deduction (documentation required). 7. Buddy System Students must complete buddy checks for short quizzes as described in Section 1. Compliance is verified by the class monitor and reflected in participation scores. 8. Problem Sets Students are expected to complete and submit the assigned problem sets on time, including discussion, code, and visualizations as described above. 9. Data Storytelling &amp; Data Story Archive Follow all guidelines for oral presentations and written archive submissions, including hard copy submission and proper documentation of R code. Consultations are highly recommended to refine presentations and archive outputs. 10. Use of Course Materials All learning and teaching materials provided in this class are for the exclusive use of students enrolled in this course, Term 2, AY2025-26. Students are not allowed to upload, share, or distribute these materials publicly or to anyone other than their groupmates/classmates without the instructor’s permission. 2.5.1 EXCUSED ABSENCES POLICY: Students must process requests for excused absences from their respective Associate Deans. For SOE students, the Associate Dean of the School of Economics will only process requests for excused absences due to medical and mental health reasons. Covid-related leave requests are no longer accepted as of August 30, 2023. Students must provide official documentation from the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) for absences related to official university functions.  Procedure: Timing: Submit requests immediately upon returning to campus and no later than seven working days from the return date.  Request Letter: Write a letter to the Associate Dean including: ○ Course details (course name, section, faculty names, and emails) ○ Dates of absence(s) ○ Reason for absence with relevant details Supporting Documents: Attach validated documents from the appropriate university offices. Submission: Combine the letter and supporting documents into a single PDF and upload viathis form. Approved absences will be communicated to you and your professors within three working days. Note that processing is done only during regular weekday office hours.  Important: Only complete requests will be processed. Falsifying records is a major offense as per the Student Handbook (Section 9, pp. 85-87). Note: The syllabus is unique to the course per Term, per AY. Final syllabus uploaded in Animospace.

First pages would be the answers to all questions together then, next pages would be the step-by-step process with code chunks in R. In printing the Quarto Markdown file for submission, put in the code chunks the following line on top where you see the {r}. It should be like this: {r, eval=FALSE}. This is so that the results will not appear in the HTML. You can then print the Quarto Markdown clearly. Only do this when you are printing the R codes.

R offers a wide variety of functionality. Note that this book only offers basic Econometric analysis. It will be useful to have some basic familiarity with R and its syntax but this is not strictly necessary. Each chapter includes both R code and results to make it easier for students to follow along, even without detailed knowledge of R. 5.1 Session Information This version of the book was built using R version 4.4.2. See below for the session information: ## R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31 ucrt) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 ## Running under: Windows 11 x64 (build 26200) ## ## Matrix products: default ## LAPACK version 3.12.1 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Netherlands.utf8 LC_CTYPE=English_Netherlands.utf8 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Netherlands.utf8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Netherlands.utf8 ## ## time zone: Asia/Manila ## tzcode source: internal ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] digest_0.6.39 R6_2.6.1 bookdown_0.46 fastmap_1.2.0 xfun_0.55 ## [6] cachem_1.1.0 knitr_1.51 htmltools_0.5.9 rmarkdown_2.30 lifecycle_1.0.4 ## [11] cli_3.6.5 sass_0.4.10 jquerylib_0.1.4 compiler_4.5.2 rstudioapi_0.17.1 ## [16] tools_4.5.2 evaluate_1.0.5 bslib_0.9.0 yaml_2.3.12 jsonlite_2.0.0 ## [21] rlang_1.1.6 5.2 Preliminaries The first step is to gain access to R, which is free and available on the R website: http://cran.r-project.org/. Simply go to the R website, select the appropriate location and operating system, and follow the instructions to download the base distribution of R. RStudio offers a user friendly environment to run R and is recommended. Once R is opened, we can begin to run commands. R commands can be run directly from the console, from the R script editor or from a text editor separate from R. 5.2.1 Understanding the RStudio Screen Console (Bottom Left) This is where you see the output from your code Error messages Warnings You can type R commands directly in the console after the &gt; and press Enter to run them. Try it! Type 3*9 Use the console for: Quick calculations Testing commands Seeing results Important! Anything types only in the console is not saved. Script/Editor Area (Top Left) The Script area is where you write and save your code or Quarto documents. This is where R scripts and qmd files are written. Code here is saved, reproducible, and reusable. To run code from the script: Select a line and press Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Cmd+Enter (Mac) or just place the cursor beside the line to run it. Run a whole chunk in Quarto Rule: Always write code in the script/editor, not in the console. Environment (Top Right) The Environment shows all objects currently in memory such as data frames, variables, functions, models. Try this: type jmn&lt;-1101 in the console. After running this, jmn will appear in the Environment. If something does NOT appear, it does not exist in your session. Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer (Bottom Right) This panel has multiple tabs: Files Shows files in your working directory. Your working directory can be seen just below the Console, the one after ~ Use this to navigate project files Plots Displays graphs created by code Packages Shows list of installed packages. Checkboxes allow loading/unloading packages but you still need to add in the code library() in scripts for reproducibility. Help Displays help pages Viewer Shows rendered HTML outputs Used when previewing Quarto documents R offers detailed help files for each function. To access help, run: ?sum All lines proceeded by a # are comments and will not run*. For example: # This is a comment. R will not recognize this as a command. 5.3 Packages Each package of interest must be installed and loaded before it can be used. The packages will not be immediately available when R is opened. A package only has to be installed once on a computer, but the package will have to be loaded every time R is restarted. We can install a package individually as we need them. For example, to install tidyverse and psych, we would do: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;psych&quot;) In the tidyverse package, the ggplot2 is usually included; if you do not see the package in the Packages list at the lower right, you can do this: if(!(&quot;ggplot2&quot; %in% installed.packages()[,&quot;Package&quot;])) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Now that we have our packages successfully installed, we can go ahead and load them into R. Here we will load the tidyverse package as an example. We can use of all the functions available in that package once it is loaded into R. We load packages by using a library() function. The input is the name of the package, not in quotes. library(tidyverse) We can look up all of the functions within a package by using a help() function. For example, let’s look at the functions available in the tidyverse package. help(package = tidyverse) Note that the package argument is necessary to look up all of the functions. We can also detach a package if we no longer want it loaded. This is sometimes useful if two packages do not play well together. Here we will use a detach() function. detach(package:tidyverse) For simplicity, we will assume that the reader has restarted R at the beginning of each tutorial. 5.4 Setting up the Working Directory MOST IMPORTANT! If your working directory is incorrect, R will not find your files and your code will fail even if it is correct. 5.4.1 What is a Working Directory? The working directory is the folder where R looks for data files, saves outputs, where .qmd files should be placed. You will only use one main local folder as your working directory (technically two: one in your laptop, one in your university account computer) 5.4.2 Required Folder Structure Create a folder: DLSU_COURSE_SECTION This folder is your local working directory. On university computers: create this folder inside your university account storage. On your personal computer: create this folder anywhere convenient for you. All qmd files must be placed inside this folder! 5.4.3 Setting the Working Directory in RStudio This method works on both Windows and Mac and avoids typing errors. Open RStudio Go to Session&gt;Set Working Directory&gt;Choose Working Directory Select the folder DLSU_COURSE_Section Click Open Once set, R will treat this folder as the default location for all files; meaning, all files in the course should be placed in this folder. Download files then place in this folder. 5.4.4 Setting the Working Directory Using Code This is a hassle as you will manually code working directory using setwd() Windows: # Use double backslashes \\\\ or forward slashes / setwd(&quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\YourUsername\\\\Documents\\\\DLSU_COURSE_Section&quot;) setwd(&quot;C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/DLSU_COURSE_Section&quot;) Mac: # Use forward slashes / setwd(&quot;/Users/YourUsername/Documents/DLSU_LBOMETR_Section&quot;) How to get the path? I forgot! Just kidding. I just right-click on the file and copy as path name. I am not sure how it is with Mac, I think same, right click but press option so the path name will show up. To confirm your working directory: getwd() If the printed path is NOT DLSU_COURSE_Section, fix it. 5.5 Cleaning the Environment (Do This Regularly) You should clean your environment at the start of a new lecture, when switching datasets, or when something behaves unexpectedly. # Remove all objects from the environment rm(list = ls()) # Free up memory (makes processor faster) gc() The Environment panel should be empty. You are always starting with a clean session. 5.6 Quarto Markdown In this course, Quarto Markdown (.qmd files). Quarto Markdown is a tool for creating documents, reports and presentations using Markdown and executable code. 5.6.1 Installing Quarto in R Before starting, install the quarto R package if not already installed: install.packages(&quot;quarto&quot;) 5.6.2 Starting a Quarto Document To begin creating a Quarto document, follow these steps: Open RStudio. Go to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document. Choose the document type (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) and specify whether the document will include code. For ease, we will use the html document type. Use the visual editor for ease of editing. 5.6.3 YAML Header Use Here is the YAML header for all quarto documents that you will submit along with line-by-line explanations. title: “TITLE of the FILE” This contains the title of the document. It appears at the top and in the browser tab. author: “put your name here” Replace with your name. Identifies the document author. date: today Automatically inserts the current date. format: html: toc: true theme: united embed-resources: true Format specifies the output type (html in this case), adds a table of contents, sets a bootstrap html theme (you can use other themes but this is preferred), embeds all resources in the html file. knitr: opts_chunk: warning: false message: false Controls code chunk behavior, meaning, it hides warnings and hides messages when rendering. editor: visual Uses the visual editor in Rstudio for the output Marks the end of the YAML header. As a whole, the YAML header looks like this: 5.6.4 Quarto Key Features Code Chunks Code chunks allow you to include and run code inside your document. To make code chunks, long way (there is shortcut later). Type ```{r} then press Enter. If you want to run the specific code chunk, you can also press the green play button at the right side of the chunk. If you want to run previous code chunks, press the button that has an arrow down with a green line below, just beside the green play button. jem&lt;-15+50+143 Inline Code Embed R code in text using backticks and r . Try typing this: The total number of pairs is “r 15+12”. Replace the quotation marks with backticks. When you render the file, what should come out in place of the backticks thing would be the number 27. 5.6.5 Quarto Markdown Shortcuts Action Windows Shortcut Mac Shortcut Insert a new code chunk Ctrl+Alt+I Cmd+Alt+I Run current code chunk Ctrl+Shift+Enter Cmd+Shift+Enter Run all code chunks Ctrl+Alt+R Cmd+Alt+R Run current line/selection Ctrl+Enter Cmd+Enter Knit/Render document Ctrl+Shift+K Cmd+Shift+K Comment/uncomment lines Ctrl+Shift+C Cmd+Shift+C Insert pipe (%&gt;%) Ctrl+Shift+M Cmd+Shift+M Headings /Number of Heading (if in Visual mode) Prefix line with #, ##, etc. manually (in Source mode) /Number of Heading (if in Visual mode) Prefix line with #, ##, etc. manually (in Source mode) Bold Ctrl+B Cmd+B Italic Ctrl+I Cmd+I Inline code Surround with backticks (’) manually Surround with backticks (’) manually 5.6.6 Rendering a Quarto Document Rendering is the process of turning your .qmd file into an html. No rendering done, no submission. In this course, you will primarily render to HTML. 5.6.6.1 Render Using RStudio Button (DO THIS) Open your qmd file Make sure it is saved in the working directory Click Render button at the top of the editor. It looks like a blue arrow with the word Render. RStudio will run all code chunks, convert the document to HTML then open the result in the Viewer pane. If the render is successful, an html file will appear in your Files tab. You can double-click on the html file in your Files so that it appears in a bigger window which you can use to print as PDF. 5.7 Working Directories and File Management You will always work locally first. Each student must: Edit .qmd files only inside their local DLSU_COURSE_Section folder. Render HTML files locally to check for errors Never edit files directly inside Google Drive via a browser 5.7.1 File Naming Convention (Mandatory) To avoid confusion, all .qmd files must follow this format: initials_topic.qmd Example: jmn_descriptives.qmd jmn_visualization.qmd/ 5.8 Mini-Exercise: First Quarto Render (Mandatory per Individual) This exercise checks that you can write, run, and render a Quarto document correctly. Instructions: Create a new Quarto HTML document in RStudio. Keep the YAML header exactly as shown earlier in this chapter. In the body of the document, do the following steps: a. Add a Section Header Below the YAML header, add the following Markdown header: About Me as Heading 1 Under this header, write 2-3 sentences introducing yourself (name, program, year, hobbies) b. Add Inline Code for your age In the same section, add a sentence that includes inline R code. Sentence: I am “r 2026-type your year of birth” years old. Do NOT calculate your age manually. The age must be computed by R. The number should appear as plain text in the sentence. c. Add a Code Chunk Insert a new R code chunk. Inside the chunk: Add a comment saying this is just a test Create an object named after your initials Add the alphabetical positions of your initials Print the result Example: #This is just a test jmn&lt;-10+13+14 print(jmn) ## [1] 37 d. Render the document This exercise will help you in future lectures! e. Create a new Quarto document Clean the environment and free up the memory. Don’t forget your YAML header before the code chunk including the cleaning and freeing the memory! "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
